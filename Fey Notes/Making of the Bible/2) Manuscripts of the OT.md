## Texts: 
-Samaritan Pentateuch
	- Only first 5 books

Masoretic text: 
- they latched on to one form of the 
- What is most common is addition, not omissions
	- There is no "lost" bible
	- There is really 103% of the bible that exists

biblia hebraica stuttgartensia: 
- main text is linengrad codex
- All modern english translations of OT are based this translation,
	- different philosophies behind each translation bring forth each new translation of the Bible.

*God speaks through people, it is through history and human process that God has given his revelation*

English bible: 
- tindale & KJV (authorized version 1611)
	- based solely off of masoretic text (mainly linengrad codex)
		- When do we go with a reading that is different than masoretic text?
		- [[Jer-10]](6-7, 10) - additions to Masoretic text when compared to other texts
			- likely passage was crafted in shorter form
			-Is the message of the passage changed? or theology changed? 
				-These passages actually parallels and quotes the book of Psalms 
				-"reading this passage in light of the book of psalms"
				-Not people reading fast and loose but reading along the grain of the rest of the Bible

**When discrepancies happen from references from the NT to the OT texts, because the NT is quoting from the Septuagint, therefore the wording might not match up completely.**
	- Sometimes this doesn't matter, but sometimes this does make a difference

Masorites are trying to maintain references and tradition in the margins to keep for future generations.
- not out of trying to move people away from the truth

More updated translations: 
- NIV updates: 
	- included more footnotes from other texts

## Manuscripts & NT

NT is best well documented ancient text (or text in human history)
- NT has 6,000 copies
- homer and Plato, etc. - 40-50 copies
	- The real wrestling is with the composition and contents of the bible, the manuscript evidence is so overwhelming that it's not really debated. 
	- There is still so much of the Bible to wrestle with. It really is the point of the bible, to wrestle

writing of books of NT: 
- All written between 45-100AD
	- latest either John or Revelation of John 

The Gospels: 
- The teachings of Jesus were translated from Arameic to Greek 
- there is a 40-50 yr gap between Jesus' life and the writings of the gospels
- ethigraphic studies and storytelling research

Like a finished quilt: 
- Is the age of the quilt the same as the age of the materials from the quilt. 
- [[Luke-01]] - there are a lot of accounts floating around all over
	- many have tried to collect these pieces 
		- Mark was first, Matthew and Luke took mark and added other quilt pieces. 
	- God them from eye witnesses & servants of the word (officially dedicated storytellers- apostles or storytellers from the community- common in oral cultures)
	- Theophilus: A patron of Luke most likely
	- Only passage like this in the bible (Tells you why, and how)
	- Richard Bauckham: Jesus and the eye witnesses #Author 

John has some material like Mark, Matt, & Luke. 
- John is drawing from different quilt pieces than other gospel accounts
- They are coherent in basic points but 

Letters: 
[[Rom-16]](1, 22) - Tertius is actually the one writing the letter, just like book of Jeremiah
	servants - someone who passes on the writings of someone
		this also means she is teaching the words
[[Rom-01]](1,7) - Paul to Romans


[[1 Pet-01]](1) - From Peter
[[1 Pet-01]](12) - with the help of Silus 
- Written in high style greek 
	- He brought along someone who know a high style greek 

How did the letters spread? 
- [[Col-04]](16) - this is how Paul intended for his letters to be spread
	- These are case studies of how Paul's theology is applied to specific cases
	- Now the work goes in to discerning what items are specific to each group of people and what is more general for all readers.

Calendar was put together wrong by about 4 years - the calendar wasn't developed until 500's or so



## Discussion:

Reading the bible is like walking through a library or museum

How literal is the bible itself? 
	- If they are dropped from the sky then you kind of have to take them literally

If someone had a literal mindest of Genesis or John
- Did Jesus reference events of the OT as historical events?
	- It is a lot easier to take the stories as literal 
	- What the text says (pashat), then there is what the text is "saying"
		- Like shakespeare: if only read for plain text would you really understand what he is talking about. Saying it without saying it.
	- You are limiting yourself, 
		- you are not ruining the plain text to look into the text to see what it is "saying"
		- Then the Dunning Kruger effect shows you that the plain meaning really is not close to all you should know about the text.

People read the text as if one sentence proves a doctrine
	- This makes sense when you look at this one sentence alone
	- But do you think that the author's intent was for you to read this whole section or story and get this one doctrine from this one sentence? 

Eugene Peterson’s #Author  book, Eat This Book. In it, Eugene recounts a conversation with one of his Jewish rabbi friends, who said:
“For us Jews studying the Bible is more important than obeying it, be- cause if you don’t understand it rightly you will obey it wrongly and your obedience will be disobedience.”
