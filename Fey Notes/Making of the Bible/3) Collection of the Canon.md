Canon - "A collection"

Transmission of the NT is distinct: 
- 200 years of Jesus movement is growth and spreading 
- Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, ephasis, etc. - Major urban centers copying the text 
	- different branches of text manuscripts started emerging. 
	- Gives more puzzle pieces that help us understand the true underlying text.
	- Not one person in a room copying it themselves trying to trick someone else
	- It was public document


Significant differences:
[[1 John-05]](5-8)- they introduced the trinity in one set of manuscripts in the asia minor tradition (western manuscripts)
- the trinity is not a new idea, but it is definitely different
- Addition happened in one set of traditions (asia minor)

[[Acts-06]](8-9)- minor narrative embellishment - "refuted him with boldness"
- Acts has maybe a dozen of these differences
- Scribe thought he could airbrush this story

It's complicated because people were involved and that is okay. 

Early 300's:
- 1st Widespread systematic persecution/execution (diocletian)
	- systematic destruction of churches and all "holy books" in their possession
- Some differences in some places but not others
- The result was a shortage of new testaments
	- Then there was a large need afterwards
	- This resulted in large copying centers (4 listed above)

1516:
- Desiderius Erasmus - Tried to compile first scholarly edition of the NT
	- had a few hundred manuscripts at the time
	- But only had one tradition of the text (The Majority texts)

1526: 
- William Tyndale published first translation of bible in english
	- this was illegal at the time 
	- not just priests and scholars, but everyone should be able to read the bible
	- from best Greek manuscripts he had

1604: 
- first writing of the king james version
	- based heavily on the tyndale bible 
	- still only written from one strand of manuscripts

British empire: 
	- began modern archeology 
	- Constantin von Tischendorf - Codex Sinaiticus - Mt. Sinai
	- Samuel Prideaux Tregelles
		-  People dedicated their whole lives devoted to this
	- Suddenly they start discovering all the ancient manuscripts from historical sites around the world 
		- digging up everthing they can and start discovering loads of 
		- texts in Egypt, Rome, Syria, etc.

Example:
'Thine is the kingdom, the power, and glory amen" - not included in more ancient versions of the Lord's prayer.

Didache (120AD)- Lord's prayer was basic and everyone learns it and says it
- someone probably added this out of worship

Some manuscripts only found 40 yrs. after the originals??

1960's: 
	- Erwin Nestle & Kurt Aland
		- put together the "Nestle Aland NT"
			- currently on it's 28th edition
		- Every English translation is based off of this greek text 

Why are there all these English translations? 
	- English like no one speaks it (interlinear)
	- NASB: good for word studies
	- Net bible
	- ESV: Difficult English
Sometimes you need an English phrase (dynamic translations)- does not mean less faithful, but there will be interpretive choices made, but all translations do this.
	- The best translation is the one you read
	- All translations are a form of interpretation
	- Does my translation convey the meaning of text, then that is God's word. 
		- It is rooted in the words but still the spirit moves through the words to affect people
		- "The scriptures"

### Canon
Canon- Greek word in English letters
	- means: rule, measure, or list

Authority:
	*The bible is not trying to draw attention to itself, it is supposed to be drawn to a person*
	- The authority belongs to him
	- The bible is one way in which the authority of Jesus is working itself out in the world
		- Like the concept of acting "In his name"
	- The authority of the bible- All authority is in Jesus and the mission he has for us
		- *It is to spread the message of healing transforming power of the gospel and his resurrection*
			- If the bible doesn't help us do this then it is leading us astray

The old testament was Jesus' bible and displays the God who Jesus can to embody and represent

*Scripture: Texts that tell this story, or unpack the meaning of the story, and guide the community in living out the story.*

### other texts? 
- What text's rightly understood the story? 
	- This is hard to understand as the people of this time seemed to have strayed so far.

Hebrew texts: 
	- Luke 24: Torah, Nevi'im(prophets), ketuvim (writings)
	- Apocrapha books: 
		- Jewish writings before Jesus and around him
		- declared to be a part of the bible in 1546 by the pope:
			- Luther was challenging themes and teachings based off of these books so the pope doubled down on the teachings by adding these books to the canon.
			- Seem to be mainly a reformation political stunt
			- Catholics will view that the decision of the pope was God's will.
		- Neither Jesus or the apostles quote from these books, or talk about them as though they are scripture. 
			- What about the prophets?


Greek Texts: 
	- [[2 Pet-03]](15-16): Peter was aware of Paul's letters, they were difficult to understand for them as well
		- They distort his words just like people distort the hebrew scriptures
		- Paul's letters were compared to the hebrew scriptures, it seems as though they are aware that what they are going is a new work of God that continues the work of the OT.
	- Discussions in early church fathers:
		- Connection to the original apostles
		- Books that were widespread (missionaries, copied,etc.)
			- although not completely solidified until the 4th century, the same books become very popular in all of the early Christian movement
		- Rule of faith: do these book represent an aberration from the core message of the gospel
			- There was a reason why they were lost gospels- because they were never in the bible.. they were a solo group in Egypt.
	- There is no official council that decided the canon 
		- There was the council of Rome in 382AD
			- recognizing what was already happening in all of the churches
			- "ratification of what had already become the common practice of the churches" - Everett Ferguson
- They preserve the core statement about the gospel accounted by the apostles
	- the process was messy, but the product makes a lot of sense
- **The bible rose out of the mission of God working out in the world**
	- and out of the church growing and spreading
	- It rose out of the spread and growth of the church 
- The messiness speaks to how God is still working the world because we is working with humans now so we can expect messiness.

### Discussion

NT other books: 
	- 1 & 2nd clement
	- Shepherd Hermas
	- Epistle of Barnabas
	- Apocalypse of Peter
	- Book of wisdom

Gospel of Thomas: found in 1945: could be written between 60AD-200AD
	- Origin was first reference 220-230 AD

1 Enoch: 
	- It seems popular because it provides insight into Genesis 6
	- not included in any canon, but is quoted or referenced in the NT

Deuterocanonical books were included in the Septuagint and in the council of Rome in 300's AD.

jewish rejected Septuagint as scripture in 4th century as they were concerned about the differences in canon w/ hebrew Bible and because of growing popularity in christianity
