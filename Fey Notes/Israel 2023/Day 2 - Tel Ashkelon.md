# 2 Major Shelves of Understanding:

## Importance of the land in a physical sense
- Right in middle of continents 
	- Major empires on each sides that wanted to trade 
- Between desert and sea 
- People had to come through this area, Major trade routes: 
	- The way of the sea (NS)
	- Kings highway/desert highway(NW)
	- southern trade route through Judah(EW)
	- Jezzreal valley crossing (EW)
- Most battles took place along the trade routes 
	- 5 principle cities of phillistines (all in the area where way of the sea met the southern trade route
	- all along the major trade routes 
	- Philistines took advantage of making money off of the trade routes 


## Importance of the Land in Spiritual or Cosmic geography:

Devine beings (elohiem): 
	- [[Gen-06]] lists divine beings coming down and marrying with the daughters of Men and "messing up" God's plan.

### God appoints divine beings to nations:

The people of Israel were supposed to spread out and be fruitful and multiple and **"fill the earth"** but they did not, they gathered together and tried to make a name for themselves. 
- God forced them to spread out and form nations of their own in doing this he also gave them their *gods*.

	- [[Deut-32]](8-9) - "he set the boundaries according to the number of the sons of **God**" (Septuigint) (see more below), Are the sons of God judiciously ruling over the nations? Divine counsel? 
	- [[Deut-29]](25-26)- they served other gods (Elohiem), who God had not given to Israel (The assumptions is that he assigned them to the nations but is that true? Could God not have assigned them to the nations and Israel fall away and worship them?)
	- [[Deut-04]](19)- could this mean that the starts, moon, and sun are given to all people? not that these are gods that were given to the nations? Could this not just be him talking about how they worship God's creation instead of him?
	- [[Exod-12]](12)- God will execute judgment on all the god's(elohiem) of Egypt
	- [[1 Sam-26]](19)- David associates the nations with pagan God's, implying that living in other nations would mean worshiping other gods (elohiem).
	- [[Rev-20]](3)- The Satan will be locked up so he can no longer deceive the nations anymore. 
	- [[Ps-29]](1)- Command:  Acknowledge the Lord "heavenly beings"
	- [[Ps-69]](1)- what heavenly being is like God?


The pattern of Israel is:
- follow the Torah-> they inherit the land and blessings.
- Don't follow Torah -> exile from promises. 

This is supposed to be the land that radiates out to the other nations. 
- the nations get disinherited and then Abraham walks faithfully in wisdom. Then others see it and want to bring torah to their lands.

The Messianic kingdom: 
	- The Torah being brought to the nations is the sign of the kingdom
	- One day the nations will flock to Israel and learn of torah and take it back to the rest of the world


We're Jews supposed to be evangelistic? 
- when in God's land with God's plans and his Torah. It comes to life
	- the nations are supposed to be drawn to Israel in the land 
	- The nations will declare this is the "most high God".

[[Deut-32]]
- Moses' farewell, to generation that will be going into the land. He reiterates things that they should have already known 
- V7- 
- V8: Sons of God - older version 
	- Show up in Job, satan and the sons of God
	- In Job "The sons of God rejoiced"
		- Created heavenly beings
- He divided the nations according to the sons of God. 
	- There was no "sons of Israel " back at the time of Babel 
	- If it is the sons of Israel, there are 70 in [[Gen-10]]
- V9 - but Jacob is mine! 

There is an overlap of the human people and the god's associated with the areas
