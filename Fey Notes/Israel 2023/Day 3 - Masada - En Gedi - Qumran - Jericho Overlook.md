Yeshua entered into the conversation and did not entertain rebellion or choose sides.

## Qumran 
Qumran: 1947-48
- scrolls were on average 2,200 years old ~ 200BCE
- state of Israel is about to be formed again when these were discovered
- Part of scrolls acquired by gov of Israel, part of them were controlled by Jordan
	- Jordan conquers the eastern mountainous parts of Israel including parts of the caves  
	- The sections the belonged to Jordan were held and manually translated slowly by a select group of people that did not include any jews
		- This brought controversy and some conspiracy 
			- many thought these texts might indicate the end of christianity & judiasm
- Sectarian weightings also included in these texts (literature writings):
	- Son of man was a phrase used in common literature 

The copper scroll: scroll written in copper parchment. Used laser technology to open. Lists a map where treasures of temple were located. 
	- Jim barfield: discovered it corresponded to Jerusalem. 
	- Vandal Jones: is allowed to dig 18 ft., was only allowed to dig a few feet.

Jesus was a person of the temple, he was there in the temple during the feast of dedication (Hannakah)

The book of ester was the only book in TNK that was not found in the dead sea scrolls

Big things happening in the 40's for Israel:
- Germany was the most Christian place in the 1940's

## Conversation with Shayna: 
- Messianic Jews are a large minority in the Israeli community, most who profess the messianic tradition are actually jews who have now become Christians (through replacement theology)
	- ~80,000 messianic jews in Israel today, 10% or so actually retain their heritage
	- It is difficult to find community because with jews you are rejected almost immediately when you mention you are messianic
		- How do you balance between being open and not revealing and possibly being seen as deceptive? 

- Israeli citizenship you have to be related to a jew to the 2nd generation to be granted citizenship.
- Israel is unique in that the nation actually has a God given command in how they rule their land and treat their land. Therefore it is a government that is considered a theocracy mixed with a democracy.
	- How does this balance with the understanding that Israel is still in exile? 
		- What rules still apply and what do not?
- It is required by Israeli law to serve 2 years in the Israeli defense forces if you are a citizen in Israel. 
	- This is more of a right of passage, and it is hard to get a job in Israel if you have not done this.
	- unless you are of the "ultra orthodox " sect of judiasm
		- Do ultra orthodox have a good reputation in Israel?
- Israel has one of the highest birth rates in the world. (3.1 per woman)
	- driven by ultra orthodox and healthcare
