## Great Synagogue 

Shuckling - comes from the word "ruach"- that means spirit and wind, they move back and forth like they are blowing in the wind to symbolize the spirit moving through prayer. This is also in a bowing motion for reverence. 

Masoretic texts have Hebrew cantillation marks
	- This began around the penning of the masoretic text as the hebrew language seemed to be dying out and they wanted a way to make sure pronunciation of the text remained the same.
	- It serves 3 main purposes: Syntax (punctuation), Phonetics (pronunciation/accents), Music (providing tones to assist with the former and remembrance)
	- There is a professional who reads this in synagogue called a Cantor, with someone reading it simultaneously checking for errors to ensure text is spoken correctly.

Cosmic authorities: 
[[Ephes-06]]- against rulers, spiritual powers in the heavenly realm 
[[1 Cor-02]](6)- if the rulers" (spiritual beings), knew of the wisdom of God then they wouldn't have crucified Jesus. 
[[Col-02]]- disarmed the rulers and the authorities 

God used the death of the messiah to disarm the "rulers". 

The cross was a setup jab for the kingdom punch. 

God is reclaiming the nations early 

Demoniac: "is it time now"- they know their demise is coming, they just don't know when.
