Hanoch: 
- sees Yeshua as a great rabbinic mind 
	- 4.5-4.75(on 7 step scale)
	- Boaz: "If we could get Jews to no. 2 then I would be happy"
	- Had Christianity not started then we would be using teachings of Rabbi yeshua in the Mishnah 

- Is yeshua messiah?
	- Christian's and Jews look at messiah differently 
	- What we are seeing and expecting are 2 completely different things
		- For Jews it is a 2 do list that must be completed before they are declared messiah: - there is no concept of needing to "know messiah"
		- Jews have no understanding of a divine yeshua or divine messiah.
			- The Jewish concept of a messiah is a human being (not divine) become ruler of Israel empowered to make world peace. Israel dwells in security, exiles are gathered, and temple is rebuilt. As a human being he will die and his sons or son will inherit the throne. 
		- Concept of 2 messiahs 
			- Joeseph dies in battle
			- David does all these things 


Relationships between Jews & Christians: 
- you shouldn't be looking into you to be me, or me to be you

Menachem Mendel Schneerson: 
- Chabad- outreach, helping Jewish people in a non-judgmeantal way. 
- Number of his fathers that believe he will return to the world as a messiah 
	- It contradicts what we have believed about messiah for a few thousan years
- The righteous of the world- Jewish concept- will rise in time of messianic redemption. 
	- Don't know what or how this will look -it's mostly speculation 

Isaiah 53: talking about nation of Israel, not an individual 

We should be working together to bring messiah together. 

How to hastening the return of the messiah: 
- come to Israel and begin to understand what the Jewish people are about. 
	- The land is chosen, the people are choosing 
		- You don't have to do or follow something. 
- Resettle the land, bring the exiles in.. etc. they will receive divine favor and usher into the messianic era. 
- We are participating in something that has not prescedent in history. 
	- T'shuva- an issue of individual responsibility. 

In the end days Torah will be brought to the nations, it is possible we might be the top of God doing this?
