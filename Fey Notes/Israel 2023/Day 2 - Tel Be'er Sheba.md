Seasons in Israel:
Increasingly barred in the summer 
- Rains from Nov.-March 
- Talmud mentions the "forests of Israel"
	-  Israel was deforested by ottoman Turks & Egyptians (for fuel- late 1800's)
	- started reforestation in early 1900's

Lower lands of biblical Israel 
Negev: lit. South 
- this is biblical Negev 
- Transition area between no water and lots of water 

## Be'er Sheba
4 horned altar: 
- pre- Babylonian 
- altars should be of uncut stone 
	- This is cut stone 
	- This isn't in Jerusalem 
- This must have been when they were not following Torah
	- syncretism - merging worship systems
	- *Idolatry: the worship the wrong god or the right god the wrong way.

Last places in the text: Samuel's sons come down to Beersheba to be judged and they are not good dudes. [[1 Sam-08]] (1-9)
- this place eventually gets destroyed by kings trying to reform things 

Tamerisk tree:
- Abraham planted a tree in Beersheba
- This is the 2nd time mentioned after God planted a tree in the garden
	- Abraham bringing order out of chaos like God did

He is a stranger in his own land 

Beersheba: "well of an oath" or "Well of 7"

Be'er Sheba was a place where God reaffirmed his promise with his people for the land and blessing: 
	- Abraham makes a covenant with Abimelek here to define the land he is in. (this is originally where it got it's name) [[Gen-21]]
	- God affirmed his covenant with Issac that he would be fruitful and be the father of many nations because of the merit of Abraham, Issac swears an oath with Abimalek and Phicol to bring peace to the land. [[Gen-26]]
	- Jacob, after joseph is reported alive, travels down to Egypt and stops in Beersheba - God reminds him that he will make a great nation from him and will bring him back to the land [[Gen-46]]

They all come here in the midst of their trials to reaffirm his commitment for them to have this land 

### Hagar
- In a similar way God met Hagar at a well and made a promise to her that her descendants would be numerous. (Beer-Lahai-Roi) [[Gen-16]]

Hagar: "the sojourner"
- sojourner: "gar" 
- Ha: article

When we are attached to the God of Abraham, we as sojourners are also given a promise of multiplication?


### Syncretism: 
- like Americans and how they 
- It is easy, we all fall into it 
	- Requires us to be in constant conversation with the scriptures and with biblical community 
- It is easy
