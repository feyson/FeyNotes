[[Mark-11]](16) - Jesus tells people not to take shortcuts through the temple and disrespect the area. 
- This shows that yeshua is actually PRO temple

We will need it in the kingdom, death and sin will be there. Still will need ritual purity 
	- you will not need it in the new kingdom

	- [[Lev-23]] yom kippur- purpose was not to create a covering, but to clean the temple so God may dwell there 

Atonement- lit. At one ment
- church word made up 

If purity doesn't take place year after year, then he will leave with the people in exile. 

Who said that Jesus would not have still died, maybe the nations could have come in and killed the messiah & rose again (the righteous dieing)


Paul says God decided to have the nations come in proleptically (early)
