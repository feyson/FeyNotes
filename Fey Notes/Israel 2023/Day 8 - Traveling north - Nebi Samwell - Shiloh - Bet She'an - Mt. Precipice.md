## Nebi Samuel (Mt. Joy)
- "Navi "- prophet 
	- Holy site for 
- porch of Jerusalem 
- Central Benjamin Plateau 

Benjamites being killed off and 600 being left. They felt so bad about killing all of the tribes that they broke an oath to keep them going. 

There is kind of family protection over Benjamin now. 
- Saul from Benjamin 
- David from Judah 
	- First becomes king of Judah 
	- Moves capital from Hebron (Judah), to Jerusalem (Benjamin)
		- Diplomatic move to bring unity to the tribes
		- it would be easier to operate militarily from Jerusalem (ease of movement, location at center)
	
	- David continues to try to extend things to try to win over the other tribes:
		- Nafiboseth 
		- Shami the benjamite calls him names, David responds by not killing him 
		- Has opportunities to kill Saul and benjamites and does not to bring unity
- Rivalry throughout the whole story there is a rivalry between 
- Bejaimin was the only other tribe to join Judah in breaking away. 
- Paul brags about being in the tribe of Benjamin 

How did joeseph figure out if his brothers repented: how they treated Benjamin. 

- shows how the story of Benjamin resulted in the unity of Israel 
- It only tells you the details that they want you to understand 
	- The Bible is not journalism 
		- Here is what happened and here are the facts
		- Bad journalism, gives you facts that you want to know for propaganda 
			- That is what the Bible is doing.. see John... not sure this is a great analogy. It is not supposed to be journalism 
		- All the information builds throughout the stories, they don't give back detail because you are supposed to build on past stories. 



sons of Saul they get hung (David allows them)
- gineonites: Joshua moves up in the area- they decided Joshua and they made a covenant with them. 
- Saul put the gibeonites to death (he broke the covenant ) [[2 Sam-21]]
	- A famine happened because of this 
	- There was no replacement of the covenants 
	- 7 men of his descendants and they had to kill them (impaling them )

Muslim & Samuel: 
- they were prophets of muhammad
- But where are the texts that were before they were corrupted 

Sibling rivalry:
- joeseph and judah
- Joshua takes them into the land 
	- Joshua then goes in and goes to Ephriam 
	- Torah commands them to go to that area
	- Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Torah at all
		- Not focus until judahite brings the center of worship to Judah 
	- Ephriams country is focus of torah 
	- Ephraim 
	- Juda and have issues with semaritans
		- from a semartitan perspective they think hashem chose ephriam and David ruined 
		- They think judeans misappropriating after Shiloh falls and moved worship center down to Jerusalem 
		- king of Assyria brought other gods into the area
		- They don't want the temple in Jerusalem (neh )
		- The hot topic of semaria is where do we worship 
		- 
		- Yeshua was on the side of the judeans when talking to the semartitan woman. 
			- He acknowledges that true worship is more important than the place you worship 
			- he acknowledges they are wrong
			- Yeshua dismantles the argument and brought her into the fold 
			- Do our teachings bring division? 
			- Do our teachings work past the hot issues of the day 
			- Shomron- lit "to keep" meaning to keep the original instruction 
				- This is where they get Samaritan 
			- Semaritan Pentateuch mentions that the altar should be built on mt garazim 

The northern tribes and phoneas dropped the ball and so the 

The covenants are not hyper grace 
- we have covenantal responsibilities





## Shiloh 
- where Samuel is called here 
- Ark of covenant 
- Runs through ephath and gives Eli the bad news news and Eli falls over and dies 


- Priests who are unrighteousness but because of their ritual purity they can serve before the law? 
	- Did ritual thing that is wrong and they are killed 
	- Ritual purity and moral impurity are not the same things 
		- He will eventually take out the immoral priest eventuall
		- righteousness before god is a cosmic issue, not a physical issue. 
		- Morality Jenga blocks 
			- Moral purity that seems to be overlooked affects the moral purity of the whole nation over time

			- can't come in with mud all over you, you need to be physically pure 
			- If I forget to be kind, generous, etc. over time 

[[Jer-07]]- 
- repent and you can live here 
	- Don't listen to those who think God won't destroy his temple.
		- No justice, sojuourner not taken care of, other gods
	- Go to Shiloh and see what I did there
		- stealing the offerings and fooling around with girls.
	- This house has become a den of robbers
		- Yeshua quotes this in the next temple 

What will God do if his people will not repent? 
	- he will do to the Israel what he did with the people at babel 

Where Saigon fell down before hashem. The priests of Dagon would jump over the soil.

	- Word is chocolate going into the word. 


## Bet She'an

- important trade rout intersection 
- Saul and Jonathan hung here
- Yeshua's methodology didn't follow this style of teaching. 
	- We do the exact opposite of yeshua's mental model 
	- They understood the church as the kingdom 
		- Come into the church to get saved
	- Protestants don't believe that, but the church has the message of getting saved.  - "come to the church to hear a great message to get saved"
		- Like the church is trying to sell you something. 
		- Jesus did the opposite 
- Pursuit and discipleship vs. programs and trying to attract crowds
- Yeshua - byzinetine
