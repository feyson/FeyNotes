7 Steps: - Abram Poljak3 #Author 
- Cease to condemn him
	- He is condemned not because what he said but because of what people have said about him.
- Think about him
- Recognize him as brother
- Accept him as a teacher
- See yeshua as the central jewish figure
- Acknowledged as a prophet
- Identified as messiah

if you skip steps 1-6 (like most evangelism), then you create a Christian instead of a Jew. 

What if we as Christian used these 7 steps to reconcile with the Jewish people??
- cease to condemn the Jews
- Think about the Jewish people
- Recognize Jews as a brother
- Accept them as teachers
- See the Jews as a central figure of God's story
- Acknowledge the prophets and word of God as the Jews'
- Yeshua brings a jewish message and is a jew

"the parting of the ways" - when jews and Christians split

If we think that you can't be Jewish and Christian then you think that Jesus can to convert all Jews to Christianity and eliminate the Jewish people. 
- Evangelism is not about killing or taking souls from the jews (this is what most Jews see Christians doing)
