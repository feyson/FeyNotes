Does [[Lev-19]](19) and [[Deut-22]](11) condemn wearing mixed fabrics? & [[Deut-22]](9)
	- The underlying assumption of the prohibition is that set forth in the Creation account of Genesis I-God made everything "after its own kind," and thus any attempt to mix the created order is seen as a violation of his will.
	- deliberated changes or accidental at the cost of the animal or at the cost of it's image 
	- Relates back to the theme of dominion  
	- God wanted to create a respect of the created order 
	- Nephillim w/ man/woman - God wanted this wiped out because he did not create it.
	- God created distinctness and in the same way calls us for distinctness. Although we are created to create, there are distinctions that God makes on our create (mainly his #torah) that we must use as our boundaries.

 [[Deut-22]](6-7) “If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young. You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go.
	 - Most take this law, found only here in the Pentateuch, to be an example of the humanity and Sense of fair play inherent in God's Law. It also shows that God cares for the least among his creation. He wants Israel to care not only for their neighbor's possessions but also for all his creatures.
	 - Honoring motherhood, she is willing to risk her whole life to care for another just so you can capture her and her younglings

[[Exod-21]](5-6)“But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’ 6 then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.
	- Was the servant to go free in seven years? Or in the Year of Jubilee? Does "forever" in Ex 21:6 preclude the Year of Jubilee in [[Lev-25]](39)?
		- [[Deut-15]](12-18): increases the same rights to female slaves. This seems to imply that they would be set free after 6 years.

 [[Num-05]](11-31)"If a man's wife goes astry, and is unfaithful to him so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband... the priest shall take holy water in a clay jar; and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water ... then the priest...shall say to her... May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.”
	 - we should attempt to understand what the writer has given us, not what has been left out.
	 - illustration of God's personal involvement in the restitution for the sin of the nation. Within God's covenant with Israel, there could be no hidden sin among God's people nor any hidden suspicion of sin.
		 - through the role of the priest, God was actively at work in the nation and that no sin of any sort could be tolerated among God's holy people.
 
[[Exod-22]](2-3): “If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed.
	???

[[Lev-10]](6):  Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the Lord will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed by fire.

 
[[Exod-23]](19) “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk. 
	- Referenced 3 separate times, all in different instances/contexts
		- most times it appears like it is just tossed in
	- You can't meet dairy & meat together?? - modern interpretation
		- went from a kid in a mother milk, then a kid in any milk,.... until any kind of meat and any kind of dairy... that is how they got there. 
		- even in Jesus' day this was a done deal...
	- God likes distinction, especially thinks that have to do with life and things that have to do with #death. 
	- Every time you sin, you are brining death into a place that is pure with life. 
		- motivation for listening / righteousness
		- With the #spirit, every time you sin you are mixing death and life
	- "in its mother's milk" is one that still suckles from its mother (Ex 34:18-26).
		- Thus the expression "Do not boil a kid in its mother's milk" is intended to state the principle that only weaned animals are to be used as offerings. As such it is similar in function to a maxim
		- other passages show, the same expression can be used in quite dissimilar contexts (e.g., Ex 34:26; Dt 14:21)

[[Lev-19]](27-):
	- In [Leviticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus "Leviticus") 19:27, Jews are prohibited from "destroying" the corners of the beard. The [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud "Talmud") (Makkos 20a) has different views on this, to mean the use of a single-bladed razor (as opposed to any scissors-like device which requires two blades to cut) or to remove any beard hair even with tweezers.
	- Combat similarities to other neighboring countries? 
	- Beards are highly regarded, and presented to God as worship? 

[[Lev-01]]: #olah offering: 
	- God sees and identifies the different economic situations, and offers everyone the opportunity to participate int he freewill offering. 
		- with feathers, not to pluck
			- this causes lots of smoke and smells, but this allows for the burning to look much bigger like a larger animal (caring for the weaker)
	- God is always judging the motive behind the freewill offering not just the 


[[Deut-23]](6): you must not seek prosperity for them (Ammonites & moabites):
	- "10th generation" - idiom for forever
	- A result of Lot's interaction's with his daughters
	- Moab does not show love to their family:
		- after the Exodus they did not serve them
		- Balaam was hired to curse them
		- went to temp Israel with sexual immorality
	- Don't hate the Edomite or Egypt
		- Egypt was co-victims with Israel to the Egyptian leaders
	- We should have the right to judge those who are inside the assembly
		- when your family was in need, did you help them? 
		- [[1 Cor-05]](12-13)


[[Deut-09]](12), [[Num-15]](37)- Tassels

[[Lev-25]](46):

utterly destroy all life: 
- The reason why he wants to wipe out the nations: ashera poles and child sacrifice
