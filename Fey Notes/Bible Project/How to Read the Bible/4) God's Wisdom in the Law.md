Written law is just one way to express the ideals of justice
- The authors saw them as a source of divine wisdom, guiding God's people to a divine ideal of justice:
	- And so are the narratives, proverbs, psalms, etc...

Some laws feel like moral embarrassment in the modern world, but to realize the ethical ideas in their world were revolutionary. And our current world is built on the foundation of these ideals under these laws.

Ethical Monotheism 
- We separate these concepts from the religious worldview we have a living contradiction - this is the west
	- When people don't look at these in the cultural context, it can almost seem like they are fighting against these ideals, and don't realize they are actually the seedbed for these ideals themselves.
	- Can a culture sustain these without their connection to religious heritage
		- It most likely will result in a slow regress away 
	- They either hate that it comes from jewish/christian roots, or don't know that it does int eh first place.
The problem is not the ideals but the humans: 
	- Pebcak - "problem exists between the computer and keyboard"
	- defective end user
	- "I am the problem, it's me"

We look back on the past and the future will look back at the present day with disgust:
	We do this with the founding fathers:
		- How could they not fight for complete Women's suffrage & end racism 
		- We can look back now and saw it was not that great, but it was the thing that lead to where we are now

God challenged that society and pushed it towards the eternal Torah, how do we do not now in our society?
	The Torah is timeless principles, we shouldn't have to modernize it. 
		- but we are reading it in near-eastern text. It is difficult for us to read into the test and read the principle out.


## Laws are a part of ancient near-eastern tradition:
The laws are adopting a cultural framework and practice from their near-eastern neighbors. But there is is a seismic shift happening on the worldview level that sows the seeds for the abolishment of slavery or other justices..

Most people are in the tribute posing class
In Babylonian mythology, everyone is supposed to be slaves except for those who are related to the divine (ie. the kings & family)
	God's got lazy so they created humans as slaves (The Atra-hasis)

### All Humans are Created Equal
- Using traditional example of #slavery

Wrestling with slavery:
https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/305549/jewish/Torah-Slavery-and-the-Jews.htm

#book
	Created equal - Joshua Berman (scholarly)
	Justice for all: how the jewish bible revitalized ethics - Jeremiah Unterman

Covenant relationships in near-eastern cultures
	Almost all are between kings, only one other is not
	- The Biblical covenant present's itself as a king making a covenant with a whole people group not another king
		- I will be their God and they will be my people - Marriage vow, a variation is in Psalm of songs - "I am my beloved, and my beloved is mine"
		- This could be described alternatively as a "kingdom of kings"
			- Like the "Image of God" title is usually only given to kings
		- *All of Israel is elevated to the role of a royal covenant partner with the king of the universe*
			- This elevates their value significantly
			- The Idea: "All men are created equal is such a extreme thought"
				- But how does this deal with Romans 1??
		- The idea of a God making a covenant relationship with a people group is crazy absurd!

Slaves in other cultures should want to be a slave in Israel. 

When you look at the laws regarding slavery or land, it takes all of the incentive out of having slaves. 
	- Makes the endeavor less worth the investment into slaves.
		- you have to release them after a certain amount of years, etc.



### Human Rights, Welfare, & Social Equality
Priests and kings are extremely downgraded when compared to counterparts in culture:
	instructed not to amass wealth
	Priests given narrow range of authority (can't even own land)
*This is a turning upside down of the priestly & king class*

The whole economy is aimed at achieving a level of social equality that is unheard of 
	- Debt release every 7 years
	- slaves being set free every 7 years
	- No interest loans in Israel
		- [[Deut-23]](19)

There would be major peer pressure to be a functional member of the community.

What would happen if no one charged interest? 
	- There would be a lot fewer loans
	- The loans would be coming from your neighbor
		- Different level of accountability
	- Further knits the community together

Introduce a reformation of ancient worldview to achieve social equality
	Not egalitarianism introduced in French revolution of inaliable rights
- Based on an economic system that seeks equality that give sacred value to the extended family household. 
	- people assist one another in labor, granting relief, common ownership
	- rejection of statism or feudalism 
	- Free of tribute (only tribute was to temple)
- opposition of empire of oppression, and monarchies
	- Monarchies are born out of deep compromise, and compromises the covenant partnership
	- Critiquing human monarchies


- Sam Harris #Author - Those ideals are not the sole property of the jewish/christian tradition. But are ideals within the human condition.
- David Bentley Hart #Author - What's mist beautiful about the western heritage is specifically the Jewish/Christian heritage. And the horror of the wester narrative is the abuse of these ideals. 

### When you go into battle
[[Deut-21]] (10-11) - Genesis 2 design pattern 
	People might mistake this law in promoting this
	- The authors are not endorsing but seeing that it is going to happen and trying to regulate it in a moral way.
		- This is normal human behavior for most of history
		- 1) You give her a month without touching her
		- 2) You let her grieve
		- 3) You don't get to sell her because she is not your property 
		- Working the revolution from within... You could see a wise Solomon saying lets not do this

- There is hope that there are principles behind other laws in Torah as well.
	- 

# Reading Torah as narrative
Understanding how divine commands fit into the plot line. 
- the 611 are not the first commands
- Divine command and a human being tested is the garden of #eden story
- Law's given to Israel play a subordinate role in the full story
	- They are not there to give you a sample, but to play a role in the story

### Because you have listened to my voice

What is their Role? 
- The Lord God commanded the human [[Gen-02]](16-17)
	- Enjoy the good world but do not **discern on your own what is good and not good** for only God can do that. 
		- Not a part of the 611 but still thematically a part of the commands int he narrative
	- because you "listened" to the voice of someone else [[Gen-03]](17-19)
		- listened and obeying are connected
		- The humans keep failing the listening test
			- We need people who *Listen to the voice*
		- "Who's voice are you listening to?" - Marty

Abraham: 
[[Gen-12]] - takes Gen 1-11 curses and reverses the curses and blesses instead
- He didn't fully listen [[Gen-12]](4) - he was supposed to leave his family
	- Lot became the source of innumerable problems 
[[Gen-16]](1-2)- Abraham listed to the voice of his wife - leads to failure
[[Gen-22]](16-18) God test's Abraham, how far are you willing to go to have your own son
	- Restatement of promise given in [[Gen-12]]
	- He passed the test
	- *Because you have listed to my voice*
	- [[Gen-16]](3-5)- restating the promise to Isaac, 
		- The command statutes and Torah don't exist yet??
		- Abraham listening to God's voice is equivalent to him following the commands of #Torah 

To live by faith is to obey the commands of the #Torah 
	- You don't even have to know them, like a law unto themselves -Romans 
	- You don't have to know Torah, you can be obedient as long as you are willing to listen and obey - Abraham is the prime example of this.
		- It's not about the rule keeping, but the hearing

*The purpose of the #law is not obedience, but to know God intimately*

Example: 
	Think of how many things you do, or do a certain way because of your spouse without an edict or covenant. 
		The more we know him and understand him, the more we do things differently because we know him


### A New Covenant
[[Exod-19]](4-6)- "listen, listen"- to obey
[[Exod-32]](1->) Then proceeded to worship the golden calf

Abraham did pass the test, it is possible...
We need someone who can listen to the voice permanently so that blessing may be released permanently
[[Deut-30]](15->) - Don't eat of the tree or you will die
- Shema his voice

[[Jer-31]](33-34)
	The only way Jeremiah sees this happening is what the law would be written on their heart, so that they would "know me"
[[Ezek-36]](25-28)
	It's by God's spirit he will put a new heart in you

*Torah is a new covenant document*
Old covenant- implies that these texts are somehow the old covenant.
	- They are a narrative of how humans fail to listen to the voice
	- It has always been the #test of listening to the voice
		- One example has 611 example of how to do it, but nestled in a narrative of how they failed to do so
- It shows you why we need a fundamentally different kind of divine/Human relationship

Covenants are additive, not replacement in nature
	Is God faithful or not? 
		Yes he is
	How can God reject or #replace Israel and still be called faithful? 
		He made eternal covenants for all generations

## Discussion notes:
people always try to jump to a list of rule and try to keep them, the command given for the tree has the same backing as some of the other laws. 

The 611 may be specific for Israel, but the 5 books are filled with all kinds of principles that are mirrored in the law.
	- All of them teach us about his will and desire is, what true justice is, what his character is like

At first God **saw** what was good, then other characters seem to see what is good in their own eyes: 
[[Gen-02]]- eve
[[Gen-06]]- Nephalim
[[Gen-09]](22)
...

In the #Talmud "Abolish & fulfill" was a common phrase in the time
	- When they think something is the character of God or interpreting it correctly they call it "Fulfilling Torah"
	- When people speak out of an interpretation leading to sin they call it "abolishing Torah"
