# Summary from previous episodes
~ 10% of the whole bible is ancient near-eastern legal & ritual laws
	- this is often the verses sceptics go to show the bible is irrelevant
	- or people will get thrown or disturbed

Rabbi's in Talmud: 
	They created more but also consolidated into themes
	Rabbi Similai come to a similar position as Paul in [[Hab-02]] (4) that the righteous will live by faith

For the people who want to follow the law:
	It is a big problem for those who are not in the promise land or w/ the temple
	- They replace it with other things or determine the principle or a truth underneath the law, but they work around the actual meaning of the law (ex. offering a sacrifice of prayer instead of an animal sacrifice)

For the gentiles: 
	Part of the law is to show a distinction between the ones of the covenant and those who are not
		- Ex. Sabbath or Circumcision
	Do I have to follow all of these things? 
		particularly for a messianic movement

What we find in the bible is not a comprehensive list of Law 
	- Common law vs. Statutory Law
	- It is an embodiment of some higher moral ideals 
	- But day to day you don't actually live that way
		- But how is this different from how we interact with the law of circumcision or 
	- Ethical values are not only communicated through a law or direction through paul, but also through narrative 
- Modern Law code
	- Your wife doesn't hold you accountable to the words of the text 
		- you have to get up by 7:00!

Ancient law code was not used as a judicial 
	- Not a supreme authority
	- An example of one time and place in how to embody the value and ethics of the society

## The Laws: An Embodiment of Wisdom
The Laws in the Torah are not a law code but covenant wisdom

- Raymond Westbrook: Scholar - #book 
- Bernard Jackson - Wisdom Laws #book
	- All law codes are a part of a moral wisdom tradition
	- [[2 Chron-19]](1) - God is with you when you give judgement
	- [[Prov-16]] (10) - Divine intuition
	- [[2 Kings-03]] (16-28) - doesn't consult rulebook
	- Combining local custom, with divinely guided intuitions of justice. relying on practical wisdom that existed withing their consciousness of their people
	- The most important qualification in a customary law system is the moral character of the judge. 

# Divine Ideals of the Law

## The Laws Embody a set of symbolic ideals

Any law is an application of an ideal
Why didn't God give us these buckets?
	The laws are not the only expressions of the ideals..??

## Law groups (buckets)
It's interesting that we do this but we don't encourage others to do this
What are the core main Ideals being worked out in the Law?

### Calendar laws
normal time vs. holy time

Sabbath: [[Gen-01]] [[Genesis 1]]
	- The pattern of beauty and order out of chaos in the first 6 days and then declares there is a day to rule and enjoy it. 
	- No concluding formula on day 7
	- Humans fail to achieve the divine rest [[Gen-02]]
- God intends history & human/divine partnership to culminate in a time of rest & rule. 
	- The 7th day was never realized 

Let's find time to live like it actually was happening
	doing it as an anticipation of all creation reaching the rest God has intended for it
		Living in the #newcreation
			The ideal for the world is not to live in the daily death struggle
			The meaning of existence is the royal images of God to rule in partnership, justice, in community over a creation that responds in harmony

#### Holidays
ritual calendar is based on 7 day sabbath cycle
holidays based on patterns of 7's
Passover: liberation of creation from slavery into the new creation promise land
Day of atonement 
festival of tabernacle 
	The days of "awe" - 7th month
year of jubilee

The world is sacred but compromised, we haven't yet achieve the sabbath.
- *Making a claim of the world, looking backwards, and anticipating the future rest

### Sacrificial laws
The first sacrifice is Noah's 
[[Lev-01]] - olah - to go up
- this is the burnt offering
the hope is to one day to ascend back up the mountain
[[Isa-22]](2)
only the righteous and complete can go back to the righteous new Eden
- In the meantime we offer whole and complete animals and the sacrifice translates them to ascend into Eden on our behalf. 
	- Like #resurrection: it transforms the mode of existence to get into the new #Eden
- The Ideal is to ascend to the new Eden and creation

Using sacrifice as the construct to meditate and realize how we get to the new Eden. 
	Why are we not in the new Jerusalem? because of the stupid stuff that we do everyday
		we offer sacrifices when we mess up
	We offer this as an anticipation and in our place to return to the new Jerusalem

God banished us from the Eden mt. so we don't introduce death and evil into his new creation
Who shall ascend the mountain of the lord #book  - L. Michael Morales

### Holiness & impurity
Represents:
Pure: life wholeness, health, new creation
impure: death, decay, mortality

Ritual behaviors that remind you that God is the source of life and beauty, and is separate of the life of impurity. 
- about resurrection again
The hope of being in the new Eden

### Civil law

Loving your neighbor because they are the image of Law

### Criminal law
Violent conflict...

Sexual misbehavior 
	adultery (considered criminal)
		It affects the community in this culture
		It destabilizes the whole community

This is all about the "ideal"
	it is not a law to be married one man & woman together. It is not a law but an ideal.
		The laws are different expressions from it.

They anticipate the future kingdom, and try to recreate an ideal "Eden"
	The speed limit is an embodiment of an ideal, the need to care and love others as more important than business and saving time to getting to a place.

Examples:
[[Deut-24]](21-22)- civil law
[[Deut-25]](1-3)- limit on beatings; so he is not humiliating
[[Deut-25]] (4)- civil law; love your ox as your would love yourself. your neighbors are also the ox
[[deut-25]](11)- You are damaging the future of their family. Like taking someone's life savings/inheritance
	Was this ever practiced? 
		there are cultures that still do this today... so we could assume so
	God is revealing himself to Israel and calling them to a higher standard of Justice, meeting them as he finds them and enacting a moral revolution within them.
	- You can't just drop a whole new set of laws on people, it has to be a change of narratives and ideals
[[Deut-25]](13)- Civil law; don't cheat people


## Questions/Problems & Discussion: 
- How do I think about some of the more common laws that were pervasive (and still are) in the Jewish faith. (Ex. sabbath & circumcision). Are these merely "Ideals"? Why do we take these so literally as a law code and yet other laws we do not? 
		- Circumcision: we understand meaning behind it, but it is more difficult to look at the wisdom behind circumcision... it's not obvious
		- Sabbath: you can look deeply into this, and see lots of wisdom
		- Some refer to Jewish identity, and some to God's attributes
	- There is a Statutory element to this law, this was the terms and conditions of this covenant
	- Maybe Tim & John are trying to get outside of the mindset of statutory law that they are disregarding all statutory nature of the law. Their point is trying to emphasize God nature and character behind the law for us to look at.
	- Law's which one is greater? Which principle is greater? 

-Criminal Law, how does this differ from civil law
	- A thought:
		 - In civil law punishments are money or animals or something
		- Criminal law you suffer something directly
			- you have already taken something you can't return

-Jewish courts would not have been looking back at the laws when making decisions? 
		- Couldn't they have used them as some form of statutory laws? 
		- How do we make these decisions without letting your sinful biases interfere?
	- It seems as though the focus was on the ideals, thoughts, wisdoms. Even when using the law & commands as a reference.
	- They are judging the things that are not obvious in Torah

Why do I care about the groups or classifications or laws? 
	Like guide posts or guide rails.
		- Initially placing them in a category will help you not veer off in another direction? 
	Everyone learns differently 
		- if someone is overwhelmed, they can look at them and simply identify them into categories 
		You can gain some real understanding and allows you to dive deeper into detail

Argument: How important is the oral Torah?
	Some claim they are equal
		Their Argument: 
			-But that is the thing that got passed down, the written form is a byproduct of history that came into being over time.
			-To say one is more valuable is incorrect
	Some say written has priority over oral Torah

How do we understand marriage being between one man & one woman? Is this a law or an ideal? 
	- Even the idea of Sabbath is an ideal at that point
	- Marriage transcends the Law, it was present before and some of the law stands 
	- It is impossible to define marriage by laws, but you can define some laws that might be helpful
	- Polygamy was common during the time the Torah was written (even in Israel)
		-Even in the midst of this God portrayed the ideal of one man & one wife
			- God might want to see how it goes in partnership
			- It is seen over & over again that this resulted in failure and hardship.
			- This resulted in Paul being more explicit about it in the New Testament

It's a fine line of making a fence around Torah, and doing it at the expense of someone else.
