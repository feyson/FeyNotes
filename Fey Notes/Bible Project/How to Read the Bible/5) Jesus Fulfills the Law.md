## The whole purpose of the law was fulfilled in Jesus and the Holy Spirit

There is only one command we have to follow: *Listen & obey*

Torah should be a magnifying glass used to see the divine will, but ends up magnifying the human condition with sunlight and burning the family of Abraham - N.T. Wright #Author 

listen to the voice and you will find life
	but the command to listen means there is a choice

The thing that God gave his people to guide them to life becomes a tool that leads to death when perverted. 
	- The introduction of a divine command introduces the possibility of failing the command that leads to death
	- The command is necessary based on the nature of the relationship
		- It is the relationship with the other
	- The universe is this gracious gift and God wants to share this life with another. 
		- for the other to be an other then there has to be some freedom of the other
- The good laws also remind us of the things that happen when we don't do the good things

Israel's oppression under foreign empires have been going on for a while now. 
	He comes embodying the Torah 

[[Rom-07]](7-8):
	- Snake and sin in his mind
	- now I know what coveting is and I want to do it
	- when you get divine commands, you get people doing the opposite of the commands right after
		- Apart from a command you wouldn't know you are breaking the command
	- Recognizing sin as sin
		- coming under condemnation 
		- Sin is naming death as an unfortunate evil tragedy, and that behavior as morally wrong
- When you talk about the right and wrong thing
	- even though it was still wrong
		- his point is that you know it, and are morally responsible for it and do it anyways
	- The knowledge of doing wrong
		- "Knowing good and evil"
			- defining good and evil
			- ability to discern what is good and doing it
			-There are some things that we naturally do that are wrong,
				but now I know it is not good and still do it
	The paradoxical role of the Torah 
		drawing an observation about human nature from pattern of divine commands in the law

How can God's law that gives life also be the thing that brings destruction??
- The emphasis was never supposed to be on the tree of knowledge of Good and evil

[[Rom-07]] (8-9
	- now that you have been made aware of it, now you can do it knowingly
	- Is there condemnation before 
	- Could he be talking about Adam instead of himself?
	- It seems like there is condemnation before the law (see [[rom-05]])


Who is the "I" in romans 7? 

It was sin being revealed as sin [[Rom-07]](10-12)
- make humans more copiable 
- but the family of Abraham should be the more equipped to succeed

[[Matt-05]](17)
- the whole story points to a person who needs to listen to the voice!

[[Matt-05]](20)- your right status with God is going to be at a whole new level that accomplishes the whole ideals behind the law. 
[[Matt-05]](27-28) - the 6 antithesis of the sermon on the mount
	- The law is just one application of an Ideal, the ideal is the real truth behind the law.


### Fuel Analogy 

Who or what is being punished on the cross? [[Rom-08]](3)
- peri hamartias (geek) - sin offering -> olah in hebrew
- Sin was condemned on the cross int he flesh of Jesus
	- so the requirement of hearing and obeying the Torah can be fulfilled in us
		- We do this by walking in the spirit, and not int he flesh
- *It's not that God hated humanity and punished Jesus, but that God loved humanity in it's weakness and failure and punished/condemned sin in Jesus on the cross.*
- The mode of existence ruled by the cosmic tyrant (flesh)
	- The serpent, the beast, 
		- the inherited generations of humanity's moral failure 
	- physical, and moral existence int he world
	- The snake is being punished on the cross in the flesh of Jesus

The energy 
- The divine command passes the 
- giving a person some gasoline, are they going to make a bomb or take a family on vacation
	- you give us fuel and we won't be able to use it like we are supposed to

But the new humanity given the tools can actually use them to bring life. 

### Wisdom for all generations
- The laws are a source of wisdom for all generations
- my covenant relationship with God is determined by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
	- but they are a part of the heritage 
	- pointers to an ideal that I serve to learn from

Language in proverbs is derived from Genesis
	- [[Prov-01]] (7)
	- [[Prov-03]](13 &18)
	- The fear of the lord is the beginning of knowing
		- **Finding wisdom is access to the tree of life**
		- fear of the lord is a gate 
		- The fear of the lord is what enables us to know when to say enough, so we can return to the garden
	- you will get what you really want, by not taking what you want
	- We are too easily satisfied 

Wisdom is the fulfillment of the Shema [[Deut-06]](4-6) command 
- [[Prov-06]](20-22)
	- The divine command is being reconfigured as the heritage being passed from the parents to their generations.

Jesus uses this law as wisdom to define principles we should be following 

[[1 Cor-09]](9-11)
	Paul uses the muzzling of an ox to depict a divine principle


How to look at the Laws:
1) look at immediate context around the laws
2) read contextual ancient counterpart laws
3) define core theological claims of "buckets"
4) find the wisdom principle you can apply in different ways (Through the spirit)
5) filter every law through the summary of people who love God and others

The point is to create people who can know God's will
	The point is to decern God's will

*Humans fully in tune with God through Jesus and the spirit who know how to listen to his voice and do his will, and all the anticipated futures that are yet to come*

[[John-05]](19-24)
- He is the first human who knows and does God's will

### Discussion:

"knowledge of good and evil" - not that you do not know what is right or wrong but:
- you will have the experience of deciding for yourself what is right and wrong
	- *defining what is good and evil by yourself*
	- God is always is declaring and "saw" what is good
		- Eve "Saw"- and declared what is good

Human nature: 
- Are we born with a sin nature or not? 
	- haven't sinned when you were born 
	- after birth you have to bring in free will, what does that mean? 
		- It all comes down to listen & obey 
		- The free will to either chose his way or our own way

If your righteousness does not pass the scribes and pharisees
- It's not that your good works have to be greater, but that we have to find the application of the ideal behind the law. 

There is a statutory nature of the law 
- because there are certain parts of the law that are statutory like
	- The law is in Torah, but not Torah
	- These are terms and conditions of the covenant between God and Israel
- The pharisee's were focused on the statutory part
	- All of the ideals behind 

In [[Matt-05]] Jesus is bringing the people back to what the real meaning of the law was.

Can the Jewish people gain wisdom and understand w/out having the spirit to help them discern wisdom from the Torah.

Were people saved before Jesus? 
	- God is unchanging, there has always been one way. 
		- They can still listen and obey
	- Sacrificial system clearly not a payment for sin

"I believe in Jesus" just like "I believe in Santa Clause"
	Are you listening & obeying? 

What does it it mean that the #spirit aids us in gaining wisdom 
- We see in scripture that in history of Man there is activity of #spirit with man [[Num-11]] (16-17)
- But also Pentecost in 1st century was a big change
- The apostles gained an understanding of the scriptures light years ahead what their understanding was when Jesus was there? 
- Secession: 
	- Was it the only the first generation?
	- Was it the same or different than when before 
	- What portion of the spirit did they have before? or after? 
- Non-Secession: 
	- If spirit is supposed to be with us all, and learning, etc. 
	- Then how can it be that with all these Christians' we are all on such different pages?!?!
	- When you are hearing a voice
		- it could be enemy
		- it could be yourself
		- It could be the spirit
	- But in what way is it helping
