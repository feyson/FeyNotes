# Principles of the Law

## Not a Law code
#Law
#Torah  Lit. "Instruction"

The narrative presents the law as the terms of a covenantal agreement between God and his chosen people Israel. 
	The laws are illustrating the terms of the agreement
	The narrative is very instructive

The authority of the covenant relationship is the relationship itself.

Narrative example: 
	You go on a hike you make a set of rules of engagement for you and your partner. Thus you have a list of laws.
	Some of the laws were borrow
	Years later you write a narrative about the hike and include large parts of the agreement to teach you from the trip. 
		-This is like what our Torah is.
*It is based on the relationship*
- A covenant relationship is specific between two people to accomplish something. 

Covenant terms vs. Law code:
- There are laws within the covenant terms of the Torah that are directly from near eastern law codes. 
	- The way they conceived of God wanting them to live fit within their cultural context. But also adapted it 

1st revelation of law: sandwiched between a marriage ceremony 
[[Exod-20]](1-2)- 
[[Exod-19]] 
	(5-8) - 

-[[Exod-24]] - 

## Terms of the Covenant
[[Exod-19]] (4-6) - if you list & obey then you will be a kingdom of priests and a holy people
	They were to be *formed by the relationship they had with God take on the character traits of God: justice & generosity, etc.*

The selection of the laws: 
	They are designing it to show that the laws are not going to be upheld
		Ex. have no other God's before me, then immediately they brought the golden calf

What is the purpose of the narrative?
	is it trying to say that I should be performing the laws? 
	Or telling me something else?

## Code of Hammurabi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi

discovered by Gustave Jequier
Shamash - Sun God
	he is handing a ring and staff (symbols of devine authority) to Hammurabi.

Law code starts w/ narrative to establish Hammurabi & the backdrop of the 

### Similarities w/ laws of the bible 
Gen. 1 
	Sun, moon & stars rule & 1 human ->images of God
	in Gen all humans are images
	The temple on earth is an image as the heavens
		Same thought world as bible

List of 282 Laws:
196: Eye for an eye, bone for a bone
	In Torah: Lev. 24:19-21

250 & 251: Ox goring restitution
	In Torah: Ex. 21:28-36

129: death penalty for adultery & kidnapping
	In Torah: Lev. 20:10; Ex. 21:16

*Thus is what an ancient law code looks like, this is not what the Torah looks like*

Joshua wrote the law code on a standing stone, we don't know what that is or what it looked like.
[[Deut-27]] (2-3)
Joshua...

Joshua Berman (inconsistency in Torah)
	Most frequently copied texts from ancient world
		for 1500 yrs. copied and implemented in different kingdoms
			went viral - we have dozens of copies
	we have thousands of legal documents from babylon and such
		but none of them quote the code of hamurabi as an authority for decisions (even though they are relevant to the law code)
			Sometimes these decisions aren't even in alignment with the code of hammurabi
			This means that the law codes existed not for judges to us in a judicial system, 

**If they didn't use the code as the authority what did they use as the authority for making judicial decisions?

## Discrepancies within Ancient Law Codes
Scholars of ancient law - father: Raymond westbrook

Different cultures do different things with law codes

Michael Lefebvre:
statutory law /legislative law society- the obligation is to the written text of the law
	the law is an embodiment of transcendent values of justice

Common Law /
	The law codes are illustrations of our actual values of justice
	Ex. Hammurabi: A statement of his platform 
		the specifics are an example 
		they follow the platform 
			we know they did not follow exact the 
			Their obligation is not to the code of the law, but to the sun God
			It is fluid
				Just like Moses writes "Roast" or "Boil" the passover lamb

Created equal - Joshua Berman 
	The social order created was recognizable to ancient Babylonian culture, but a radical change that was revolutionary for the time. 

*The same code can have a perceived contradiction, but they didn't view it that way because Law can be applied in different ways in different circumstances*

## The Volksgeist

Statutory Law: relatively new concept (18th - 19th centrury)
	- Rise of urbanization, immigration to cities, diverse cities, modern nation state (land borders), printing press

Common law can work in smaller homogenous societies where everyone is the same, tight social web, and have same religious and ethical values
	not everyone can read
	Common values are assumed (passed down by families)


### The transition from common law to statutory law:
1800's: Carl von Savigny

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geist
Jacob's grimm:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm
Famous lawyer of Germany
	collecting fables/ folk tables
	They were collecting the Volksgeist
		Creating the educational value code for raising kids
			how we treat each other

He believed the law must emminate from the social values of the people, so he sought out s
	Judges should judge based on range of customary law sources
		proverbs, mythology, folklore, etc..

He derived property laws from some of these fables
They viewed these folktables as some legal education

What we call narrative, poetry, and law. But all are used for instruction
	The Torah is all of those things and are used for instruction

Ex. The common law of keeping pedestrians off of the pathway
	but having to put up a sign that says no skateboards, bicycles, scooters, etc...

*The Torah is equivalent to wisdom literature*
the goal is not to do what the characters do, but learning from the narrative. 

## Old Testament Justice 

**Same problems with Hammurabi's code apply to the old testament

Ex. Appointing a judge: 
[[Exod-18]](21)- just a personal character
[[Deut-01]](15-17)- no legal education or consulting legal texts

either different than laws in Torah, or contradict laws in Torah
[[2 Sam-14]](1-2) - #David accuses Absalom
	almost like the King's words are the law at this point in time

[[Jer-26]] (18) - Most detailed court scene. He argues from precedent not from the law, no one presents an argument from Torah. 

[[1 Kings-03]] (16-28)- They saw in him the "wisdom to do justice". He had an education in Torah that trained him to become wise. #Solomon 
	They judge against the #wisdom of God.

*The Torah & it's laws were a part of a larger set of educational tools in the Israel's society*

*The source of obligation is not to a written text but to a transcendent set of values of which the written law code is one expression, and so is narrative, and poetry, writings, etc.


# Discussion

Torah leads to baseless love

It has always been about finding the heart
		Understanding it as an example of some other topic 
	Example:
	[[Deut-22]] (7-9):
	6-7 As you walk along the road, you might see a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground. If the mother bird is in the nest with either her eggs or her baby birds, you are allowed to take the baby birds or the eggs, but not the mother bird. Let her go free, and the Lord will bless you with a long and successful life.
	This actually means:
	Do not take advantage of someone else who is at a disadvantage.

The essence of the law, and spirit of the Law was present even before Mt. Sinai. 
	The minute 
	How God met and contextualized the Torah with the nation of Israel
	God have given the Torah in other contexts, it would look and sound different but would look identical when viewed properly

Cleanliness laws & #food laws? Have depth? 
	We are confident that each one has a deeper meaning
	1 overarching topic: Laws were helping men to see God's purity. What was required for man to be in relation with God. 
		We learn how much is required to be in the presence of God

Why would this not be stated explicitly?
	Why could God not have given a prelude that could help other people in different cultures understand how the literature worked? #problem
		- It was set up perfectly if the people of God actually took the Torah and passed it along successfully 
	- God has given that to the world through rabbinic Judaism that exists now. The problem is the rejection of orthodox Jewish understanding by the western world.
	- There is the Holy Spirit that is here to help as well. 
		- in the same way we are able to look at ourselves and see our own pursuit of this, the HS has to do something like this.
	- When it is time for a movement then it will be a movement...



*The goal of Torah is to form or make or change a person into the true image of God*

NT writers:
	rip it mercilously from it's context and use it for their purposes
	But when preachers do it, we don't think highly of it
		But then they were doing that, they understood the original context, there was no misunderstand.. they understood it. 
			- But in their understanding they brought it forward and bringing more meaning ot the present conversation
			- The concern now is that people are pull scripture out of context out of ignorance, not out of understanding.
