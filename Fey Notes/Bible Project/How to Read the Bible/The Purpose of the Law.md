## Background
Modern understanding: Enforcement or rules of engagement that we have all agreed on. 

If no enforcement then it is just a custom with the only punishment being a social outcast, not necessarily a law. 

come from Greek word: "polis"

## In Scripture
Lots of fast based narrative until Exodus 19-> 

Finally left Sinai in [[Leviticus]]. Then in the wilderness there are seemly random block of laws in the narrative in the book of numbers. 

Deuteronomy 12-26 are again laws (some repeated) in Moses' exposition. 

### So what's the problem, why don't we understand them?
Most problems are with us, presuppositions. 
Some are with cultural translation (once it is pointed out to you it makes sense)
	How they would have thought about law would have been different
These laws embody looking at the world differently 
	comes from a value set
		In the same way, there are symbolic worldview things. and they tie these laws together and we can become better readers of the law. 

### Are there 611 or 613 Laws?
In traditional Judaism there is a dispute...
In the Babylonian Talmud they try to understand the principles of wisdom from the laws in the Torah that then can be applied to the rest of the life. 


God gave us abundant Torah and numerous commandments:

Rabbi Simlai: 613 commandments, 365 negatives, 248 positives corresponding to man's body.

Rabbi Hamnuna: What verse indicates 613? The numerical value of "Torah" is 611..
	Proverbs 10-22 (section of proverbs): 375 verses, proverbs of 'Solomon' = 375 in Hebrew
	611 doesn't include: "I am", "you shall have no other Gods"
	There are actually only 611 thou shall/shalt nots... 
		other 2 are 1) Exodus 20:1-2 - I am the Lord God -> believe that I am the Lord. 2) Exodus 20:3 - " you shall have no other Gods" or 2) Deuteronomy 6:4-9 - "Hear O Israel"
		- 2 implicit commands

Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon= mimonities= Rambam 
	Wrote official commentary of Torah, wrote Mishnah Torah 
	- He advocated for 613, that is why it stands today (containing 2 commands that are not phrased as commands)

Rabbi Simlai: David came & reduced it to 11 [[Ps-24]] (2-5)
	Isaiah reduced them to 6 [[Isa-33]](15)
	Micah reduced them to 3 [[Micah-06]] (08)
	Isaiah reduced them to 2 [[Isa-56]](1)
	Amos came & reduced to 1 [[Am-05]] (4)
	Habakkuk came based all commandments on one thing [[Hab-02]] (4)

There are a lot of laws and there are many different ways to understand these laws. 

Ancient Jews tried to think of why and how to understand them
- by expanding them and reduce them 

They are most likely drawing on a much bigger body of laws but 611 were selected, but what is the reason they were selected??

### To Boil or Not to Boil

Problems:
1/4 of Leviticus requires a tabernacle or temple, This causes a crisis. What do we do? Rabbinic leaders had to shape new understandings and principles from these laws and try to understand them. almost 1/3 of the laws are irrelevat without the tabernacle or the promised land

In Christian history: jewish identity laws (ritual laws- purity, kosher, holy days, etc.) became a problem. Do we adhere to the laws that keep the Jewish people separate from the nations. 

Over 100 laws get repeated and are counted twice. If you compare the laws there are discrepancies. 
	[[Exod-20]](8-11) - "remember" It is inherit to the fabric of creation, bc God did, that is why
	[[Deut-05]] (12-15) - "keep" (different words), so your servants may rest as well - that land owners are equal to slaves, that you will remember you were slaves that came out of Egypt. - highlighting social equality
	- From the word of God and yet are articulated differently, stated differently to different generations. 
	- There is a core law, but in different seasons we need to talk about it differently and apply it differently in different cultures and generations
- Cultural setting- Statutory laws: You have to confront the stated law, the wording of the law is what gets debated.
- Ancient cultures- Common Law: Law doesn't exist in written code, law isn't something precisely written that you consult. But written laws are expressions of some larger law behind it.
	[[Exod-12]] (8-9) - not raw or boiled ("Bashal"). roast it ("Tsalah")
		- we could be leaving at any time, be ready
	[[Deut-16]] (6-7) - you should boil it... NIV smoothed out the contradiction
		- you are in the land at home
	-[[2 Chron-35]] (13) - "They boiled the Passover lamb with fire"
		The author of Chron. sees the discrepancies, and depict which kings are the Torah keepers. He wants to portray him as someone who obeys both commands at the same time. that is how faithful he is to Torah. 


If you see the Law as something that applies to all people at all times, then these differences become massive problems. (you might try t harmonize like NIV). The author of Chronicles uses this as an advantage. 
	- If that is what they were trying to do then it failed measurably

The purpose is something bigger than a Law code. 
- Like kids using tools for the wrong purposes... 
- You can do that but there would be problems
