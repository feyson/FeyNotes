## OT God is about law & NT is about relationship?

Is God's nature revealed more in the OT or NT?
- The purpose of the bible is not just telling us about the nature of God, but a story about the identity of God and his purposes leading up to the fulfilling character of Jesus Christ.

OT vs. NT: 
- one is more developed and more developed? 
- The OT is complex but it is a whole narrative

The law is a sub-optimal condition, the humans keep not-listening to the voice and so he had to give them very descriptive guidelines 

*The Hebrew bible and the NT are saying the same things.*
- God's purposes
- God's nature
- How the human divine partnership is going to work

## Pharisees' Understanding of the Law

Different moments require different applications of the wisdom represented in the Torah
- Example: boiling of the lamb at Passover

When reading the rabbinic literature: Mishnah & #Talmud  #pharisees
- You do not see statutory law code following, all conversations are about trying to find the wisdom and using them in their context. 
- One  motivation might be that they are trying to live out God's wisdom

## How to interpret Matthew 5?

[[Matt-05]] - setting aside any of these least of commands 
	it seems like Jesus is implying a more strict understanding and statutory approach of the laws

Context: Opening of sermon on the mount. 
- The people who are brought the kingdom and the way he is bringing the kingdom is surprising
- light of the world, city on a hill [[Isaiah]]
	-You are these people
	- Through your behavior and good works
"ligatures" - strokes of a pen

Torah has abiding authority
"commandments" - Laws of the Torah
- if you disregard the laws then you will be least in the kingdom
- Unless your righteousness surpasses scribes and pharisees 
Jesus then goes into the wisdom behind the laws....

Jesus' Point:
- Discern the divine ideal behind the law and then not to break it
	- become the city on the hill
	- use the wisdom as a guide 
- Jesus does not read the scripture as statutory

[[Matt-19]] (3)- Jesus approached about divorce:
- Jesus responded- have you read Genesis 1 & 2? (v4)
	- [[Deut-24]] (1-2) - these laws are sub-optimal [[Matt-19]] (7-8)
		- but still have divine ideal underneath the command, and you should follow that ideal
		- He elevated not getting married (v11-12)
	- singleness was a unique and honoring roles to serve God in a special way

There is not reason that it should say "but" 


## Obeying God's Law? 
not a checklist for eternal life

The divine command:
- Live in such a way that you can eat of the tree of life.

An ever present choice that is next to the tree that represents a different path that make the eating of the tree of life unattainable.

[[Deut-20]] (1->)
- don't cut down the fruit trees
- *Honoring the productivity and beauty of creation in the midst of a human project
	- an Ideal on how humans relation to environment 

Writing #Torah [[Jer-31]] (33) , [[Ezek-34]] (25-31) on your heart means people who innately obey God's wisdom as their first nature (not second nature)

## Distinguish between references to Torah, laws, OT?
Torah - "Yarah"
	- Lit. An item of instruction or teaching
	- first 5 books of bible
		- but very flexible to refer to all of scriptures [[Ps-01]], and also just to the statutes [[Ps-119]]
It is mainly context that helps us understand the meaning of the word. 
law = wisdom 


## Discussion
If you taught your child to do something and they did it, they fulfilled what you asked of them. 
- If you teach a kid to stand up when someone walks into the room, they can #fulfil it in the moment but they also have to fulfill it moving forward. There is no end. #Analogy

#Abolish / #Fulfil - to abolish it to teach not in accordance with Torah, to fulfil it is to teach in alignment with Torah.

Jesus a literal sacrifice? 
	- Levitical system, or in general?
	- as if his sacrifice abolished the sacrificial system in some way?
	- What is the actual intended purpose of the sacrificial system?
		- Was it to purify the conscious for eternity? or something else?
