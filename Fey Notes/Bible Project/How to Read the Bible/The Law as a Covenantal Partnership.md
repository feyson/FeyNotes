# Principles of the Law
## Not a Law code
#Law
#Torah  Lit. "Instruction"

The narrative presents the law as the terms of a covenantal agreement between God and his chosen people Israel. 
	The laws are illustrating the terms of the agreement
	The narrative is very instructive

The authority of the covenant relationship is the relationship itself.


Narrative example: 
	You go on a hike you make a set of rules of engagement for you and your partner. Thus you have a list of laws.
	Some of the laws were borrow
	Years later you write a narrative about the hike and include large parts of the agreement to teach you from the trip. 
		-This is like what our Torah is.
*It is based on the relationship*
- A covenant relationship is specific between two people to accomplish something. 

Covenant terms vs. Law code:
- There are laws within the covenant terms of the torah that are directly from near eastern law codes. 
	- The way they concieved of God wanting them to live fit within their cultural context. But also adapted it 

1st revelation of law: sandwiched between a marriage ceremony 
[[Exod-20]](1-2)- 
[[Exod-19]]

-[[Exod-24]] - 

## Terms of the Covenant
[[Exod-19]] (4-6) - if you list & obey then you will be a kingdom of priests and a holy people
	They were to be *formed by the relationship they had with God take on the character traits of God: justice & generosity, etc.*

The selection of the laws: 
	They are designing it to show that the laws are not going to be upheld
		Ex. have no other God's before me, then immediately they brought the golden calf

What is the purpose of the narrative?
	is it trying to say that I should be performing the laws? 
	Or telling me something else?

## Code of Hammurabi

discovered by Gustave Jequier
Shamash - Sun God
	he is handing a ring and staff (symbols of devine authority) to Hammurabi.

Law code starts w/ narrative to establish Hammurabi & the backdrop of the 

### Similarities w/ laws of the bible 
Gen. 1 
	Sun, moon & stars rule & 1 human ->images of God
	in Gen all humans are images
	The temple on earth is an image as the heavens
		Same thought world as bible

*Thus is what an ancient law code looks like, this is not what the Torah looks like*

Joshua wrote the law code on a standing stone, we don't know what that is or what it looked like.
[[Deut-27]] (2-3)
Joshua...

Joshua Berman (inconsistency in Torah)
	Most frequently copied texts from ancient world
		for 1500 yrs. copied and implemented in different kingdoms
			went viral - we have dozens of copies
	we have thousands of legal documents from babylon and such
		but none of them quote the code of hamurabi as an authority for decisions (even though they are relevant to the law code)
			Sometimes these decisions aren't even in alignment with the code of hammurabi
			This means that the law codes existed not for judges to us in a judicial system, 

**If they didn't use the code as the authority what did they use as the authority for making judicial decisions?

## Discrepancies within Ancient Law Codes
Scholars of ancient law - father: Raymond westbrook

Different cultures do different things with law codes

Michael Lefebvre:
statutory law /legislative law society- the obligation is to the written text of the law
	the law is an embodiment of transcendent values of justice

Common Law /
	The law codes are illustrations of our actual values of justice
	Ex. Hammurabi: A statement of his platform 
		the specifics are an example 
		they follow the platform 
			we know they did not follow exact the 
			Their obligation is not to the code of the law, but to the sun God
			It is fluid
				Just like Moses writes "Roast" or "Boil" the passover lamb

Created equal - Joshua Berman 
	The social order created was recognizable to ancient Babylonian culture, but a radical change that was revolutionary for the time. 

*The same code can have a perceived contradiction, but they didn't view it that way because Law can be applied in different ways in different circumstances*

## The Volksgeist

Statutory Law: relatively new concept (18th - 19th centrury)
	- Rise of urbanization, immigration to cities, diverse cities, modern nation state (land borders), printing press

Common law can work in smaller homogenous societies where everyone is the same, tight social web, and have same religious and ethical values
	not everyone can read
	Common values are assumed (passed down by families)
