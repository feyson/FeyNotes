## Central passage summary:
God continues to demonstrate his faithfulness to his promise that he gave Jacob in ch. 28, while Jacob continues to struggle to acknowledge God and instead relapses into "Jacob-ing". Jacob goes to Harran to find a wife and finds the family of Laban (Nahor's line), falls in love with his daughter Rachel but is "Jacobed" into marrying Leah (in a similar way that he "jacob-ed" his father) instead. Jacob married Rachel as well but creates a feud between the sisters for Jacob's attention and in doing so repeat many of the mistakes of the generations before them as they grasp for the things they desire. God uses this grasping of the sisters to bear the sons who become the sons of Israel. Jacob desired to leave Laban's family and schemes a way to increase his flocks before he leaves and God honors his scheming and makes his possessions great. Jacob takes his family and possessions and leaves, Rachel grabs the idol, and they depart without notice. Laban tries to catch them but God protects Jacob as he warns Laban not to harm him.
