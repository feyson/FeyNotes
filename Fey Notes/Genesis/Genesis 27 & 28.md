## Passage notes:

It's almost as if Ishmael becomes the first Israel (12 rulers with a blessing)

The big debate:
### Why can't both Jacob & Esau both be blessed? 
Why can't they both be blessed?
	- Isaac & Ishmael both get blessing
	- This is an intentional twist in the narrative'
	- God blesses Ishmael in fruitfulness, multiplication, & rule
		- but he was not of the line of the head crusher
	**1 thought:** We are getting Isaac's narrow minded view of the blessing, even if this is cultural God deviates from that . 
		God continues to use patterns of the world around him to teach people about himself.
	*God desires for the blessing to constantly spring out, but his main vehicle is one chosen lineage. But the chosen lineage keeps abusing it. The blessing is now a commodity to be stolen.*
	**Another thought:** Of course there is only one #blessing because that's how it works... but at the same time but maybe he could have been more generous because God seems to be setting the stage for a belief that, that is not how it has to work.
		God gives his blessing of being fruitfulness, multiplication & rule 
			this is when the blessing of humanity happens in Genesis 1
		That is what Cain thinks he is loosing out on
		some blessing that follows the chosen line of Seth, etc. 
	**Last thought:**  What does it mean that he blessed his son
		- Which son is going to receive the chosen lineage, only one can do this. 
			- Does Isaac know this?

2 different types of blessing? 
	- be fruitful, multiply & Rule (& firstborn)
	- The elect (line of the snake crusher)
	The blessing they are wrangling for is the #Eden blessing that God wants to give humanity through them. 

 #Birthright – spelled with the same letters as blessing but with the two middle letters swapped. 
	 Blessing (normal word) = Bereha
	 #Firstborn position = Behora

Esau says: he is rightfully called “yacov because he yacoved me!”
	 Not only has he stolen my Behora, but now also my bereha 


#firstborn is elevated to inheriting the image of the father


God instructs his blessing and rule to this family lineage, and they abuse the blessing, and corrupt it. The corruption is manifested in this. 

Rebecca & Jacob use deception to gain the thing that God has destined for Jacob in the first place

*God wants to bless the one so that many might be blesses, but this family acts like this blessing is for only one that needs to be snatched and grabbed at. 

Vocabulary patterns with Adam & eve. 
	breakdown of communication within the marriage 
	exile of Jacob after the event
	deception over food
		2 foods
	covering in skins



[[Deut-21]] you should give your #firstborn a double portion, yet God has a habit of chosing the 2nd born... don't know why

This story is very critical of the the ancestors of Israel. *We find that God's own chosen people are often the biggest obstacle for God accomplishing his purposes in the world. 

There is going to be two types of the narrative: 
	1) the line of the promise (of the snake crusher)
	2) The snake's lineage

The #firstborn is never the one who 
Romans 9-11 - It is God's freedom to chose people to carry the promise

Isaac does bless Esau, but forfeited his right to the divine promise

God turns upside down human value systems:
	- the people we think are the most important people are never the people God choses to carry his promise. 
	- Jesus is the epitome of God using the unexpected to carry his promise.

Genesis Author: 
[[Zech-08]] , [[Dan-09]]- the books of Torah came by the "prophets"
The book existed in stages, and was compiled by prophetic compilers over time.

It is through the fleeing of Jacob & Rebecca's deceit that Jacob goes to find a wife among the chosen family line. Does Isaac not remember what his father did for him? and why it is important?
- *It seems as though Isaac is disconnected from the mission of God,* and obviously did not communicate this to his sons.

What does it mean that "the the Lord will be my God?" - was he not before?
	 Jacob indicated before that "your God gave me success" (27:20)

"Then jacob departed" used as a portent for the future #exile of Israel from the promised land

Jesus uses this image in 1 John 1:51:
	Genesis 18:12-13 - the pronunciation of "it" is identical to the pronoun "him"
		Jesus applies this to himself
		The ascent and descent of the angels on the son of man refer to the miraculuos power of God that yeshua commands [[Matt-26]](53) & [[Heb-01]] (12)
		*Jesus represents God reaching down and heaven and earth touching again*, not to the same degree as in the #garden. He has made a way for touch points between God and man again.



## Application:

- Why do we try so hard to gain the very thing that God himself has given us?? love, value, worth, peace, reward, etc.. We use deceitful tactics to gain the things that were already promised to us. 
- I don't want to be the chosen people of God who is an obstacle of what God want's to accomplish here on earth.
- We have have this promise of rest and abundance, and yet we try to gain it on our own terms through money, appearance, etc.
- Are we in the place of Jacob were we are doing life and then all of a sudden we realize that God is there, you don't need to be surprised!!

## Unresolved problems:
- Differences between firstborn &  Blessing 

# Discussion

Difference between birthright and blessing? 

Is 28 a retelling of the blessing of Issac? 
	recapping 27 and the theme

Was this Issac's to give? Is it okay for him to limit it? 
	The bounty of the earth can be shared.
		v39 - "your dwelling will be from the fat of the earth"
		English translations miss the abundance 

Issac: stands in transactional 
	you go get my food and I will give you my blessing
	*There are only ever two speakers in a dialogue in the bible*
		There are 7 transactional scenes in the story
		The word blessing is repeated 7 times

The right thing is happening but it doesn't see like it is happening in the way 
God seems to be completely missing from this section of the story 

Just because they are not a part of the chosen line

v20 - he relied on Issac's experience with God and the lamb

The Lies: (5 lies)
	I am esau
	Your God grated me success
	feeling of the hands
	I am esau
	The clothing

It was Rebekah that was the deceiver 

Why does God honor it? 

Let the curse be on me, it actually happens. She doesn't ever see her two sons again. 
	they have totally formed curse
