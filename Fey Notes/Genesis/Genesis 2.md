## Notes:
- Biblical criticism theory: 
	-   It’s a simple theory, you have these discrepancies- it has to be 2 authors
	-   Even with a good defense it is hard
	    -   Occam’s Razor
	-   With the 15 discrepancies there is a theme that connects them all and if we miss them then we miss the overall meaning, they are meant to be read in series. 

  
Most biblical critics call them 2 separate stories with two different authors:
	-   “E” Author- Elohiem- dyn, justice (judge)(just stern God – making sure things are fair & square)- king
			-   Samuels spirit is called this, angels 
	- “Y” Author- YHWH- Rahemim (parent)(compassion)-creator
			-   Plural word for God
	-   Use of God’s different names in creations stories (Elohiem in Ch.1 & YHWH in Ch.2 when imparting a soul to man.
		    -   Serpent de personalized God 

 The oneness of God is tricky- there is not something in this world that cannot be separated. Physically or into parts. His oneness is fundamental, he cannot be separated. 
	    - His being is one but operating in a word where oneness is not a thing. 
		- When reflects in the world, when two things compete against each other and result in some equilibrium
		-   He has two aspects of being  
	- 2 aspects of the creative practice
		-   Professional/Home
			-   Plan
			-   Execute
			-   See if it is good or bad (plan, do, check- adjust) (Dyn)
			-   There has to be some detachment from the project or creative project when creating in this way
		-   Parenting 
			-   The above planning is not the way parenting works
			-   Stereotypical phrase from children: “Don’t judge me” 
				-   This is the last part of the creative process above… we can’t do this with kids
			-   This needs a feeling of love or compassion, I am subjectively connected to it, and 
				-   This is the complaint of Jonah, he accuses God of being soft. 
				-   God responds and takes Jonah who is so committed to justice 
					-  and gives him a shade, but found a worm took away his shade. 
					-   The worm represents the justice that took away that which didn’t belong. 
					-   The nature of compassion is subjective, the creator invests in something and it may not be logical. 
					-   If you invest in something that is going down, your advisor would advise you to not continue… but you can’t do this with a child.
    

-   God is one, so God 
		-   You must talk to us in this language due to our lack of understanding outside of this duality understanding. You have to use this language.
	-   In a world of “two-ness” there is only one way to understand the “oneness” of God by understanding the blend of Two…
-   *The tale of two names*

### Why the two accounts?: 
-   Introduces supreme God
-   The why & main characters? 
	-   Why are they both important, 
-   If this is the symphony then Genesis 1 & 2 is the melody line 
	-   You can’t get the movements 
	-   Rest & peace, spirit (ruach), 
    

  

Discussion Notes: 

-   Light existed before creation?
	-   Did God create light? 
	-   Texts in John 
		-   James 1:17
	-   God saw only that the light was good? (v.4)

-   Why does ch. 1 & 2 sound like 2 different creation stories? 
-   Lord God & God different names in Ch 1 & 2? 
		-   Elohiem in ch. 1
		-   YHVH
-   Animals before man or after? 
-   How does it being considered a poem change the way we read it? 

-   Intentions of the Author: 
	-   There was something special about these two trees?
	-   The first chapter- what is significant the starting point.
		-   God centric world view 
		-   God centric idea of who we are 
		-   Monotheistic 
	    -   Reason for obedience, everything is in perfect submission to God. 
	-   There is something special about ch. 2: 
				-   What does it cause us to see about God? 
				-   He is creating things in order, by design, God should be feared
				-   Who do you fear more, the person who kills you, or the person who could kill you but doesn’t? – This is what causes reverence 
				-   He gives creation the right of naming the animals?
			-   Is this about the story of man? 
	-   Cross references: 2:19 -> Psalm 8
		-   We are an important part of creation.
	-   To what extent are we made in the image of God? 
		-   Invitation to join God in what he is doing. 
		-   Not recognizing it doesn’t come from yourself
		-   1 Corinthians 8:6
2/24/22:
-   Tree of Life- Negative Entrapy 
		-   Rev. 2:7, 22: 14 – may have the right to eat of the tree of life (Those who do his commands)
			-   Enter the city by the gates
		-   New Heaven & new Earth- Rev. 21:1-2
		-   Go puts in front of you life and death- Deut. 30:19
		-   Choose this day whom you will serve- Joshua 24:15
		-   Like a compass what direction are you facing 
		-   Brining the kingdom here on the earth, being agents of his will
		-   If there was a fairy tale heaven why would he have created us in a place where we weren’t supposed to be? 
		-   If he took them away then it would be like God abandoning ship
-   Ch. 1 & 2 differences: 
    -   Gen 2: 4- Account= lit. “Generations” 
    -   Each section of Genesis starts with “generations” 
	-   10 total sections in Genesis

-   Gen 1-3 sets us up to read the book effectively
    -   Like poem at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings
    -   Or part at the beginning of star wars
    -   How was the scroll of Genesis put together? 
-   Image of God
    -   Woman is part is part of man 
    -   Derivatie of the material (like bread from wheat) 
    -   Helpmate that opposes – Etzer Kenegdo

3/10/22: 
-   2:17 v 3:5 – Why are there differences in the messages given 
    -   Is God lying when he says you will die and you don’t actually die?    

7/7/22: 
-   The root word for worship (2:15) & cultivate are the same word in Hebrew
-   Verse? – complete jewish study bible
    -   2:5- work the ground
    -   To “serve” – ie. To serve God-> Worship
    -   “keep” same word as obey 
	    -   He was created to worship & obey

-   The spirit & the word move together
	-   God is creating using his words his spirit is being sent
	-   They did not separate word & spirit 
	    -   Helpful view of the #trinity 

-   After spirit comes over the water it becomes ordered
-   A new Genesis with Jesus’s baptism 
    -   The Woman: 
	    -   Made in plurality to image God

7/14/22
-   V5- shrub- only other time is with Hagar 
		-   Narrative replaying in hagar- water appears
	-   “Eden leakage”
-   Plants: 
	-   2 different words for plants 
	    -   Plants in genesis 1 would be plants that would grow wild and reproduce on their own 
	    -   Plants in Gen. 2 are plant that are agricultural and would result of human cultivation


## Application:

-   True learning doesn’t happen through transfer of Knowledge; Learning happens through discovery. When we teach, we are walking people through the process of self-discovery.
-   The creation story is not about creation, but about who God is and how we relate to him.
-   Practical rest- It’s not about what your do but about what you remember.
-   Metaphorical rest- instead of insecurity or anxiety- sets us free from a mindset of scarcity to abundance.
-   Rest is the end goal-
    -   It is the beginning and the end of the story (and all the way through)
-   The most fundamentally true thing about creation is that it is good
    -   How do we view people now? Innately good or evil? 
-   Our inability to self-discovery b/c of language barriers & culture barriers highlights the beauty of discipleship and the need for it.

## Problems: 

-   Internal Question- A question that the text forces you to ask
    -   The word of God came to him, and he ran away. Why did he run away? (Jonah)
    -   The text is asking this question

-   External- Questions you have that don’t fundamentally occur in the text
    -   Ex. How could someone live for 3 days in the belly of a fish? (Jonah)

-   What is the greatest internal question? 
    -   What in the world is the deal with these days of creation? 
    -   This is the question you are dreading that everyone asks
    -   If he could do it all at once then why did he take 6 days? 
    -   Why would he make it hard for us to defend the days of creation if he could do it all at once? 
    -   6 days doesn’t make sense if the sun doesn’t show up till day 4? 
    -   Why would Torah create such problems for the readers? 
	    -   Many people trying to reconcile these days
		    -   Gerald Schroeder- “6 times of disorder and order”
	    -   Who is forcing you to obscure understandings of the word for “Days” 
	    -   But in pashat it doesn’t make sense at all
	    -   There has to be a pashat explanation of this for a normal reader (without Gerald schroeder’s book)
	    -   Their goal is to come up with some cleaver way to reconcile Torah & science
		    -   Even if he is right, he is not explaining the pashat reading
		    -  You are trying to prove allusions relate to actual scientific renderings

-   How to reconcile Torah with science may not be the main intent of the genre as a guide book.
    -   Ex. House was robbed, and little girl gives an account of the man, man is caught. and defense attorney produces recording of kid giving another her testimony to her friend 
    -   You can’t discredit her testimony based on who she is talking to. The same person is sharing the same story from different perspectives. 
  
  

-   Why does God need to name Day & Night? We name everything else
	-   V5 must be crucial? But why? 
	-   How do you condense all of creating in 31 verses?
	-   We use language to describe things in this world
		    -   But in creation you are describing something that is creating the world.
		    -   Like talking to a fish about the living room 
			    -   How do you talk to a fish about the living room using fish language he is familiar with.
				-   Borrowing the language from the fishbowl and extending it
	-   So whatever it was- it wasn’t explainable
		- Lets just use the terms day & night to use this

-   Naming the night and day allowed for it being evening & morning
    -   If it weren’t for the fact that you named it, you couldn’t say that phrase
	    -   Define evening (the coming of night)
	    -   Dawn (the coming of daytime)
    -   If I can call this light day & this darkness night
	    -   Doesn’t mean a timeframe is given
 

-   Playing Family Feud: How do you know it’s morning (Dawn)
	-   1- Light
    -   2- See the Sky
    -   3- Plants wake up (nature wakes it up)
    -   4- Sun
    -   5- Rooster (birds)
    -   6- Circadian rhythm (people animals wake up)

-   This is what creation looks like…. It is like 6 dawns… 
-   The only true days that you experience are metaphors of the very first day
	-   Ex. Out in creation at dusk…. Everything ends (the earth wins)
	-   Children don’t know object permanence 

-   Dickenson- how do they portray night & day? 
    -   The First Day's Night Had Come- Emily Dickenson

-   All these days are the ways that you experience the original the first dawn (creation)
    -   The spiritual meaning: every time you wake up- the 6 dawns have been recreated all at once
    -   This dawn reminds us of the first dawn 

-   Why say “evening & morning” without the sun? Why not just say it is the end of the day?
    -   Language, using the language to describe something we can’t really fathom 

-   Plants on day 3, but no sun until day 4?
-   If sun is not created until day 4 how are we measuring days?
    -   Days may be marked by light and dark but does not necessarily mean that it was a 24 hour period. God uses our world language to describe the creation of the world so we can understand it. 

-   What does it mean that there was day & night (light & dark) in day 1, but that the sun and moon were given to “govern the days & nights”? 
    -   There is some jewish tradition about the light that existed before the sun? what was it? 


-   Why did God rest? (Ex. David- micheal angelo)
    -   There is nothing more he could do to it
    -   It is exactly what he wants it to be

-   Why is the evening/morning refrain absent after day 7? 
    -   It is God’s invitation to trust the story as it extends forever in all places at all times.
    -   I feel the same way about you that I feel about creation


2 trees in the garden:
- Language suggests- difference is all other trees come out of the ground. 
	-   They look like trees, but their roots
	-   Good and evil (world 1) 
	    -   Categorical way used in 
    -   Another way of looking at life is thinking about life. 
    -   What is one quality of being everyone wants in world 3? Togetherness, wholeness
    -   Man Comes from the ground, and is breathe of God, and he wants to go back to oneness- to go back to the ground and to the heavens… It’s a crisis.
	    -   Animals are kind of like man. They are from the ground, but they don’t have the breathe of life. 
		-   All alone in the earth, temptations of being alone:
		    -    maybe connect with the animals?
		    -   Connect to the earth? 
		    -   He really has no way out. 

		- World 1 man: I rule the earth, World 2 man: serve it (The earth) protect it and guard it. 
			    -   The earth is where I am from it is sacred

	-   Courtship, God does not reveal the tree of life to them first thing?
		-   If you want to connect with God then obey the simple commandments
	-   Why would God create all these animals for Adam to walk through and see if they are partners? 
		-   If there is anything you call “nefesh hyah” (soul that lives) (physical and spiritual part) then you can marry it. – lit translation
			-   Soul-higher part of you
			-   What is the difference between the man & animals if they both have a mind & breath.?
				-   We became nefesh hyah through God’s breath. 
				-   There is a mindfulness that can come from earth, but our spirit came from God not the earth. 
	-   Who you be/are is most important in world 2 & what you do is most important in world 2. 
	    -   V23 hidden nefesh hyah
	-   Bone= “Essence”
		-   Therefore there are the two parts both from earth and also has the same essence or spirit
