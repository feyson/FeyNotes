## Passage notes:

### Ch. 34

Simeon & levi - think Jacob is prioritizing the daughters of rachel over daughters of leah

All of the blame is on Shechem (rise early/shoulder)
	- Not victim blaming on Dinah
	- After they never call her her actual name , while his family does seem her as a person/human being by user her name

"This should not have been done" - 
	- possibly this is the new distinction after the flood
	- "desecrated" - did not honor the sacred ways humanity should be treated 

hamor (foaming donkey)

Comparison's w/ Lot: 
	- separated from esau instead of reconciliation
	- settling near the city (reversal)
	- Abraham sitting in his tent, rising up to meet angels
	- sexual violence and destruction of people
	- 2 angles in sodom & gamorrah, 2 people destroy shechem 
	- "do as is good in your eye"
	- Prieze  were setting in the land

This just isn't flourishing, so much toil & brokenness.

Son's were with the purchased things
Jacob 'caused himself' to be silent - he did see something wrong
outrageous - A withering/wilting thing happened
1st time marriage treaty language- this is a community conversation. Not about just an individual 

Why didn't Jacob didn't do anything?
- They said you will not take our "daughter", they are stepping into the role of the patriarch 
- AT the end: very classic scarcity minset 


Does Jacob give her to him? 
	- Jacob didn't say anything...
	- Did Jacob delight in her? This guy is delighting in her, this is what jacob should have done
	- He abdicated his responsibilities, then gets mad about how it turned out
		- he could have had a part in the dialogue
		- he was so worried about what others would think about it.

It's around circumcision: 
- shows that they know what defines them as a family 
- They reverse the condition the second time




-The purpose of the marriage was to become "one people" [[Gen-34]](16 & 22)
- The last time "one people" was used was in [[Gen-11]](6) w/ tower of bable
	- going against the setting apart of the seed  of abraham
	- opposite of the Abraham's instructions to Eleazer [[Gen-24]](3)
	- opposite of rebekah's fear [[Gen-27]](46)
	- and even Issac's command [[Gen-28]](1)

Why did Jacob wait to act?
Jacob's sons are now the ones going the scheming

circumcision was a sign of the unity of the covenant people [[Gen-17]](11)
- separating from all the nations and also a sign of the covenant promise that Abraham would be a father of many nations
- In this case it was not that the cannanties were becoming like them, but that they were becoming/joining the cannanites [[Gen-34]](16)
- "sign" [[Gen-17]](11) and "consent" [[Gen-34]](15,22-23) same word
	- tying circumcision passages together
	- trying to suggest that this passage was definitely counter to God's plans.


They show the characteristic of the people that they slaughtered 

Using snake language:
- "he approached them deceitfully and their words seem good in the eyes of Hamor" - #garden 

Like the temptation of Jesus w/ Satan giving him the land. Tempting him things with something he already has.



### Ch. 35
This is Like God's call with the Prophets later 

What foreign God's did they have? 
- Not sure but it is important to show that they are purifying themselves before going to bethel

[[Gen-35]](7) - God's revealed himself to him
- The elohiem, same as last time with angels

Chiasm: 
1- bethel
	2-all people with him
		3- all rise up
			4 - Giving of the foreign God's and earrings
		5-pull up tent pegs and left
	6- all people with him
7- bethel

Why is Deborah there? - his mother's nurse
Strong twisted tree of weeping 
Abraham's tree - strong twisted tree of teaching/vision

(9)- Jacob sees God - not only Moses see's God
- Blessed- big prophetic destiny changing utterances

Why was he named "Israel" twice? [[Gen-35]](9)
- There is no explanation this time it is given
- The second renaming is to erase the negative connotation of the original naming??
	- standing in contrast with the name Jacob?
- This comes with a command from God - you shall not be called Jacob again
You aren't going to run anymore - why God harmed his "hip"

Ephrath - "I will be fruitful"
- came here, but Ironic because she was not necessarily fruitful
- used in Ruth, and their family is not fruitful either and son die in famine.

Blessing renewed: 
- be fruitful and increase in number
- kings in the promised seed
- land promised

Birth of Benjamin: 
- Bethlehem important mention: [[1 Sam-17]](12), [[Micah-05]](2),
- Rachel's grave: [[Gen-35]](20), [[1 Sam-10]](2), [[Gen-48]](7)
Israel's painful waiting for the promised Messiah [[Matt-02]](18)
- [[Jer-31]](15)

All of the former brothers had serious moral failings ( Simeon,Levi, and now Reuben ), setting the stage for Judah's development 

He strived so hard for Rachel, and God 

Jacob fulfills his vow to god [[Gen-28]](21) and returns to his father's household.

### Esau: (Ch. 36)
- Is there a chiasm here? or structure here? 
- 6 lists total:
	- 12 +1 son's 

Ishmael & Esau both get the blessings and the kingdom 
- His son's take wives from Ishmaelites 

- This passage follows the same passage as Abraham & Lot's separation
	- The possessions of the brothers were to great  to sustain both [[Gen-13]](6) & [[Gen-36]](7)
	- The heirs of the land remained while the other party parted
	- *The perils of consumerism keep us from staying together*
		- your stuff is more important than reconciliation and restoration

Why does the author indicate "that is Edom"?
- Assirian, egyptian records
	- Nations on the other side of the Jordan
		- Amon (north)
		- Moab (middle) (middian?? -Lot)??
		- Edom (south) 
- Start by worshipping YHWH (for a few hundred years), Eventually started worshiping cus
	- followed in his dad's worship
- Hassmonian dynasty oppression of Edomites until they came back to worshiping YHWH
- Herod was potentially from Edom

- The importance of Edom in later chapter's of Israel's history: 
	- [[Num-24]](17)
	- [[Obad-01]](21)
	- [[Acts-15]](17)
	- [[Am-09]](12)

Sons : 1-13
Head bulls: "chiefs"
		- Aluph - a bull
		- Aleph - the first
	- Many names are repeated in this section as "chiefs"
Kings in the land:
	- king lists are usually on a big rock, supposed to say the king and the years they reigned and when they died. 
	- 

Jacob choosing not to partner with him?

the author presents the family of Esau as a coherent and distinct whole
"chief" - only uses this term for edom except in [[Zech-12]](15-16) where it refers to the leaders of Judah
- mainly a political or military function
Sons of Seir occupy the territory of Edom and are later call "edomites" [[2 Chron-25]](11)

[[Gen-36]](31-39)
- looks forward to promises?



## Application:

- You can't abdicate responsibility for an issue that is happening in the church then get mad about how it pans out in the end.

- How often do we compromise and become like those around them because of Jacob's passivity

- why doesn't God step in until 
this isn't okay and I am going to do something about it, I am going to champion for the marginalized and oppressed/victims.

- We keep looking for God and know where he is, why did he not pitch and stay in Bethel??

- Sin = holding on to things and grasping
