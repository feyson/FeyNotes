Application:

-     
    

Problems:

-     
    
-   Did Adam & eve really not know what right and wrong is/was? And wouldn’t it be good for them to know? 
    

-   Why would the Lord want to deny them the knowledge of good and evil?
    

-   Why would God punish them from eating of the tree? This presupposes that they actually had some form of knowledge that it was wrong.
    

-   So they must have had some understanding of good and evil
    
-   But if they already possessed what the tree was supposed to given them then what is the purpose of the tree? 
    

-   Just because it was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil does not mean they were ignorant of morality beforehand.- maybe it just means they didn’t call it “knowledge of good and evil”?
    
-   Did they really understand the right thing to be “good” and the wrong thing to be “evil” and what does that mean? 
    
-   If so what does it mean to think about right and wrong in the pre tree eden era.
    

-   Didn’t God want humans to become like him in every way? (Gen. 3:22) So why did he command them not to eat of the tree? 
    

-   Theory of the Grandpa & Jimmy. 
    

-   Why did God command them to not eat of the tree of life before? Something must have changed after eating the tree of knowledge. But what changed?

-   To acknowledge him – “Thank You” 
    

-   “I want the connection”
    
-   I want him to understand that when he plays with the gift he remembers me
    

-   He wants us to understand that all these trees (gifts) are from God and that they don’t appear naturally. 
    

-   And the tree that can’t be eaten is there to remind us that God was the one that gave it to us.

-   Then you can start eating from the other tree. Thinking about what is right and wrong and what the world should be
    
-   If you haven’t learned to trust the world is a good place then who is going to take care of you… Yourself!
