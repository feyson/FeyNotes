What is God to do about a humanity that takes these blessing gifts and distorting them for false blessing purposes?

Jacob continues God's upsetting of the [[Firstborn]] tradition
Akev -heel 
yakov- jacob -> grabbing the heel

He tries to usurp his brother even after the promise given right before
	he comes out embodying the lack of trust in the promise

just Jacob steals the authority, then he stole the abundance (multiplication)

Jacob seems to encounter Angels a lot

### Jacob wrestling w/ God
[[Gen-32]]
- He strikes the hollow of his thigh
	- his hip socket is dislocated
- The source of the Man's contribution to the blessing is his 

Why does Jacob think this guy can give him a blessing
-> you have prevailed, you have 
How an irresistible force meets and immovable object

gives him the name Israel - "wrestles/struggles w/ God"
God has to wound and heal, to strike and to bless

A parable that represents the rest of the story of Israel. 

comes back to meet his brother 
and schemes up a plan to manipulate his brother

He impairs his ability to bring blessing
	Rachel may already be pregnat in which this was what stopped his ability to 

[[Isa-53]] - suffers for the sins of Jacob, but jacob is wounded for his own sins.

He is a wounded sad bitter man, God has given him many gifts but it seems as though he is not able to see that. 

The memory of what God did is carried on by their name and also the eating habits of the people. 
	
God does not abandon him in fact he promises that he 

- Jacob's life has been characterized by struggle, particularly by a struggle to obtain a blessing from God-just as in this narrative. He had struggled with his brother (chaps. 25, 27), his father (chap. 27), and his father-in-law (chaps. 29-31), and now with God (chap. 32).
	- "I will not let you go unless you bless me"

Not necessarily that the man he wrestled with was God himself, but rather it was appropriate to say so when seeing the angel of the Lord similarly to [[Judg-13]](22)
	We interact w/ God through conduits & partial experience 
		- similar to how we see the fullness of God in Jesus
		- Christophany: people think that Hebrews presents that all encounters w/ God on a personal  level

The wrestling with God is interchanged with what he experienced with Esau:
- He should have been wrestling 
- (21,22) - "Let me Atone"
	- Let me see a good face
	- after he said he saw God face to face
	- Then he says his face is 
This is the story of Jacob 

(13) - "minha"
	- Lit. "to bring forward"
	- used as offering 
- He is offering an offering to a person and not to God

He is willing to give it all up for the preservation of his own life
He only prays to God when he is in his biggest fear
	when it is convenient
	- Like the modern "christian"

God had obviously changed Esau 
Jacob never actually repents, and guilt eats him up inside 

It was supposed to be through unity and blessing, but Jacob "won out" and God let him suffer from the consequences of his actions.
	- This is like normal judgement that occurs 
	- God's mercy is taking away the consequences of our actions

New Def. of #sin : anytime you try to meet your own desires by your own means
- [[Jer-21]](13)
- When you choose to do something apart from God, it is not neutral it is against God.

It is significant that the first sin in the garden is not a moral failure, the main thing is that they are meeting their own desires in their own means.

Translation problems:
"struck him on the hip socket"
- "Struck" = touch (Very light tough)
	- plauge -> touches with sickness
	- in the #garden : you shall not touch the fruit
	- light tough
- "hip" = Lit. thigh 
	- "socket" - hollow or palm

He wrestles with us when we have not buisness wrestling with him:
	Like a father with his son

It uses similiar language to the groin 
"jesus will slay satan by the breath of his power"

Wrestling with wrestling:
- "wrestling" - Lit. contend 
- 



### Jacob Meets Esau
- The men Esau brought were not for revenge or taking spoil but for safeguarding his brother's family [[Gen-32]](15).
- Jacob's approach vs. Esau's approach very different
- His relationship with Esau foreshadowed Israel's relationship with the Edmoites (Esau's descendants)
	- They struggles with them bitterly [[Obad-01]](1-18), [[1 Kings-11]](14)
	- God will eventually bring them into the kingdom [[Obad-01]](21)

His real opportunity for repentance was with Esau 
	- God have him this opportunity and Jacob 

Esau's response was the #prodigal son...


## Application:

- Character of God:
	- God doesn't chose some else, he commits himself even more to his chosen people
		- comes down to our level and speaks our language

- This circumstance takes the place of God in his life
- Similar to protective Men in our culture
	- Hord to move forward when opposed to everyone else

- We are all in the wrestling match w/ God 
- Meditation
- Revelation
	- God is actively revealing the truth to me, and I am submitting to allow him to do so

The humility to receive now a days seems harder

-[[Jer-38]](30)
- Jesus was not the first person to call him father
- 

Repeat of the exodus story:
Pharoh touches - opportunity for repentence - succoth - more failure

## Unresolved problems:
- Did God's effort in dealing with Jacob actually work?
