Central Teaching summary:

  

Need to confront the lie that value in=s found in discipleship

  

Application:

-   Romans 12:1- Living sacrifice to God
    
-   Sin controls, and through Jesus we get to offer our bodies as instruments of righteousness
    
-   Not focusing on what others are doing in other’s lives, we need to focus on our own lives
    
-   Everyone’s circumstances are different 
    
-   When he says things, we should trust what he says and respond accordingly
    
-   Sometimes we don’t control our circumstances, but we control our Reponses.
    
-   Sin has long lasting consequences (generational sin & blessing)
    
-   Proverbs 23:7- So a man thinkith in his heart so he is.
    

  

Problems:

-   Why did God prefer Abel’s gift over Cain’s?
    

-   Abel brought the firstborn/fat portions, while Cain just brought fruit from the ground
    
-   Hebrews 11:4
    
-   Bringing the first fruit
    

-   Cain & Abel 
    
-   Will your face not be lifted up? 
    
-   God showing mercy, 
    
-   What does it mean that he left the prescence of God? (v 16)
    
-   Is it cold blooded that God would take away their purpose
